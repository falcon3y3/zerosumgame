# zerosumgame
Creating a repository for MSc thesis on dialogue extinction in the 21st century, specific focus on zero-sum game illusion in subreddits. 
To begin with, I'm generating a ground-truth data set of examples of zero-sum language derived from the subreddit r/changemyview. In order to do this, I'm reviewing a dataset published from Convokit (Cornell NLP), known as the conversations-gone-awry-cmv-corpus. This dataset specifically includes CMV conversations (6,842 conversations containing 42,964 comments) that eventually derailed and were determined by moderators to be violating subreddit rules. This data was pulled in ????
