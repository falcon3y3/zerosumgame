cue8y0b,RustyRook,"(Okay, I've seen this view come up a few times before and I've always been unsuccessful in convincing people about why they're wrong. However, it seems that your view is based on studies, so maybe you'll respond well to evidence /u/Carlosriccy.)

I cannot dispute the fact that there is a measurable IQ gap b/w white students and black students in the US. However, it is most certainly not because of genetics. Almost all of it can be attributed to social causes - black students are often in schools that aren't adequately funded, poverty and its corollary effects, etc. 

The genetic basis for difference in IQ has been tested. You can find a comprehensive review [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341646/). If you look at the science it's clear that there is no evidence that justifies making inferences about race and intelligence.

But what about all those studies in the past that showed the evidence?! Well, it's been shown that those studies (mostly from the social sciences) have been biased and unreliable. You can read about it [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15641921).

I'm curious to see how you respond to evidence.

cuec5fs,Canada_is_gay,"It's not just black and white America though. Sub-Saharan Africans and Caribbeans of African decent by far score the lowest on average of ethnic groups, with American blacks only performing marginally better. And the tests don't measure anything that is taught. They measure abstract reasoning. That's why you can give an IQ test to a child, and also why gifted children generally can score higher when they're young but usually see, even if they are truly gifted, somewhat of a drop as they grow older. The test measures one's ability to conduct abstract reasoning against the ability of the mean (a gifted child has advanced reasoning skills for their age but the ""gap"" between them and a normal child becomes less pronounced as the normal child catches up when they get older). The ""cultural"" or ""class"" argument does not hold up because the test is designed to see how well you can detect patterns and relationships without any outside knowledge of a problem. A pattern is a pattern is pattern.

For everyone thinking I'm some neo-nazi type playing white power whites also don't score the best - Asians do. Which also kills the idea of ""the concept is bias because white Eurpeans invented it"" because if it was so culturally bias why would non-white/Europeans perform better at it?

If you want to say abstract reasoning is an incomplete picture of intelligence and there are other factors and may components to intelligence you could say that and I probably wouldn't disagree with you. But it has proven time and again that blacks perform the worst at abstract reasoning. It makes people uncomfortable to talk about so people either don't talk about it or blame outside factors, but we have over a century of testing at this point. ",cue8y0b,1440450798
cuect48,aguafiestas,"Abstract reasoning is a skill that can be nurtured or hindered.  It doesn't simply depend on your genetics. Twin studies show that although there is a genetic component to IQ, it is far from a complete predictor of IQ. (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ#Estimates_of_the_heritability_of_IQ))

Curiously, the heritability of IQ is low in young children and increases with age. This suggests a complicated interaction between genes and environment.  

In addition, correlations of IQ with genetic similarity within families show much stronger correlations when children are raised together than when they are raised apart, illustrating the importance of the childhood environment in determining IQ.",cuec5fs,1440451823

I thought that was the most functional feature of unisex bathrooms, giving people privacy and safety for their bodies in the cases where doing so wasn't possible in traditional gendered bathrooms. I guess it's also weird to me that we're referring to these as gender based rooms when they're currently categorized based on people's biological sex. Maybe I'm missing a lot?",,1441205504

It wouldn't have been so bad had it been women, because we all take pity on each other during this time, but with men standing outside my stall chatting while I tried so hard to not explode was just embarrassing.

cusclcs,iwillnotgetaddicted,"I don't see why this is compelling.

How do you feel when a man says there should be no breastfeeding in public, because it makes them uncomfortable? Surely you can acknowledge that most men don't have experience with breastfeeding, and their social upbringing in many cases is at fault for their feeling uncomfortable-- not some ill intention. And yet the appropriate response is ""fucking get over it, it's not hurting anyone.""

Why shouldn't you be told to just get over it? Yeah, you did gross things in a bathroom where people do gross things. You'll get used to it. Men will get used to it.

I know these aren't perfectly analogous, and I will personally chop the head off the first idiot who chimes in to say ""but it's not the same."" I'm not saying they're the same.

cusj6ns,CharlieChuu,"There isn't a compelling reason to have unisex toilets, that's the issue. It is fine how it is. Toilets are divided by sex.

cuspq0i,iwillnotgetaddicted,"What do you say to someone who says those with the bodily function of females should do their breastfeeding in the female toilet, so that those with bodily functions of males can remain separate?

You are implying that differing bodily functions is some kind of strong justification for separation when it's not. It's an irrelevant detail. The real issue is how you are socialized to feel.

As far as whether there's a compelling issue, that's not an issue I'm well-versed in, but I think I can at least list some reasons for unisex bathrooms that are more compelling than ""I don't want men to know that fecal material comes out of my body"" or ""I don't want males to know that I have a menstrual cycle.""

1) ""Separate but equal"" rarely ends up treating both sides the same

2) It's incredibly wasteful to have to build two sets of restrooms in literally every facility in the world. Can you imagine the amount of money spent on double plumbing, double space, double the construction, etc, just so that you can pretend to men that your poop smells like roses?

3) The gender of people doesn't fall along a binary, so a binary bathroom or a bathroom with specific listings for gender denies to some people that their sexuality even exists, or has a label that, with public pressure, asks them to go into a bathroom marked differently than their gender self-identification. 

I'm not going to get invested in defending these, as I don't have strong feelings on the issue, other than my feeling that your reasons in opposition are really weak and inconsequential, and that no one will feel the way you do after just a single generation of time with unisex bathrooms has passed.",cusj6ns,1441566909

You are right about one thing, women are socialized to be delicate and beautiful and keep our bodily functions to ourselves. I'm actually okay with that, and prefer to continue in that manner. I like to appear attractive to the opposite sex, and would rather certain private functions be left strictly to my sex.  There is absolutely no convincing you can do to change my mind that doing these things with men nearby is a great idea. Sex partitioned bathrooms are fine by me!

So one bathroom for gents, and one for the ladies. that's expensive. Let's mash them together into a single room to cut costs. Makes sense.

To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?

Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? 


Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option.

cusqyxz,PanopticPoetics,"Like /u/mrgoodnighthairdo , I kind of need some more information from you to know how to approach this topic for you. I will address a few things below, gleaned from what I do have, but if you could answer the following questions it would go a long way towards facilitating a fruitful discussion: What do you mean by ""inherent""?; like mrgoodnight asked, what is the difference between humans and animals that you give moral status to one but not to the other?; Do you believe that animals have minds (a concept distinct from merely brains)?

Alright, on to what you do have.

&gt;It seems to me that killing is part of the animal kingdom.

If you think this is a marker for what makes things right, then you must think that killing other people is also morally acceptable. I can't think of something more ""natural"" for ""humans"" than killing other humans. And it is not like this killing is often without purpose. But I imagine you don't accept this, so why not? 

&gt;I would object to killing an animal when it relates to something that harms people.

If this is the case, then you ought not to support most killing of animals. It is widely known that factory farming is a major contributor to pollutants. These pollutants pose dangers, just to name a few, to local communities by contaminating things like drinking water, or globally by adding a significant amount of co2 and methane to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. 

It has also been a worry for many people for centuries that those that are cruel and insensitive to animal suffering will be cruel and insensitive to humans in kind.

&gt;Killing someone's pet,

This begs the question. What is implied here by saying the only wrong done when an animal is harmed is the harm done to the person who owns it, is that animals are considered property--property has no ""inherent"" value except by that which is afforded to it by the owner (or society). The harm done here, on your view, is an indirect harm to the owner of the animal, and not the animal itself. But this is exactly what is at issue! Do we wrong animals by how we treat them?! To answer no, because they are property--a wholly unjustified status--is to either side step the issue, avoiding the central concern, or presupposes the answer and bracket off the conversation so as to not actually deal with the explicit question. By doing this, when one says ""do we do wrong to the animal by killing it?"" you are actually implicitly saying ""do we do wrong to animal property by killing it?"" The latter question begs the question to the former.

&gt;weed or smushing a bug

There are huge differences between bugs or weeds and, say, a dog or a pig. And you know this! Your line of reasoning here seems either disingenuous or entirely ignorant. 

&gt;every animal requires ingesting other organic materials in order to survive. 

Yup. Just like how everyone needs to poop, everyone needs to eat. But from that one should not infer that we *need to eat meat*. For us humans, it is not necessary to use animals, for food or otherwise, but we can live a healthy life on a vegan diet and lifestyle (though I will admit this will probably be contested by others here, but I believe the majority of evidence on the matter strongly supports veganism as perfectly healthy and an animal diet as superfluous and unnecessary for health).

I would assign morality to people because we can communicate with each other and agree upon right and wrong actions.  Obviously there is no negotiation with, say, bears.  

Factory farming also contributes food that people eat to not die.  Could it be done better and still provide for everybody?  Probably.  For me, the the affordability of food is worth the problems that are likely solvable.  Either way, the problem is tied to how it affects people.

I don't want to see pets dying because they likely have an owner who loves them and would be sad to see them die.  I don't want to cause a person suffering so needlessly.

I group bugs and weeds in the same basket morally.  Just because one has legs doesn't make it different from a moral standpoint, at least to me.  And I would group dogs and pigs as well.",cusqyxz,1441570374
custbhe,PanopticPoetics,"&gt;Thanks for the detailed response. I mean it. It's appreciated.

No problem. I am happy you are being civil and engaging.

I am going to limit my response here to your first response about what give something moral status. I am doing this, first, because I think this is the crux of your argument. And second I don't want to spend all day doing this (sorry, I bunch of stuff I need to do today). Hopefully someone else will be willing to pick up the conversation (or I will tomorrow, if you want). So, please still respond back.

&gt; I would assign morality to people because we can communicate with each other and agree upon right and wrong actions.  Obviously there is no negotiation with, say, bears. 

So, the obvious reply here is that of marginal cases. It is easy to show that we still give moral status to humans who we can't, under your criteria, either communicate with us or agree with us on right and wrong. For example, a person who is in a coma, since they can not communicate or agree on what is right or wrong, are free to do as we please to them? Can we, say, kill them and take their organs for people that need it? Of course not! Now you may say, ""this is because it will hurt that coma patients family by doing so, and that is why we can't treat them merely as means."" But this falls into the same problem. Imagine the coma patient had no friends or family; no one would be personally hurt by the premature death of the coma patient. Is it right to do now? Of course not! If you happen to say yes it is ok, then I think you are in the minority and seriously need to reflect on the foundations of your moral intuitions. (Also, don't get hung up on the specific example, if that is your problem--there are many other counterexamples that will suffice).

What is really needed here is a distinction to make this all clearer, one that seems to be missing from most peoples conceptual toolbox. I will quote a paragraph by Norcross that give us such a distinction. This will be of particular importance to your comment, ""there is no negotiation with, say, bears.""

There is a difference between being a *moral agent* and being a *moral patient*. 

&gt;Where [you], and others who give similar arguments, go wrong is in specifying what the moral relevance [of rationality or communication] amounts to. If a being is incapable of moral reasoning, at even the most basic level, if it is incapable of being moved by moral reasons, claims, or arguments, then it cannot be a moral agent. It cannot be subject to moral obligations, to moral praise or blame. Punishing a dog for doing something ‚Äò‚Äòwrong‚Äô‚Äô is no more than an attempt to alter its future behavior. So long as we are undeceived about the dog‚Äôs cognitive capacities, we are not, except metaphorically, expressing any moral judgment about the dog‚Äôs behavior. (We may, of course, be expressing a moral judgment about the behavior of the dog‚Äôs owner, who didn‚Äôt train it very well.) All this is well and good, but what is the significance for the question of what weight to give to animal interests? That animals can‚Äôt be moral agents doesn‚Äôt seem to be relevant to their status as moral patients. Many, perhaps most, humans are both moral agents and patients. Most, perhaps all, animals are only moral patients. Why would the lack of moral agency give them diminished status as moral patients? Full status as a moral patient is not some kind of reward for moral agency. I have heard students complain in this regard that it is unfair that humans bear the burdens of moral responsibility, and don‚Äôt get enhanced consideration of their interests in return. This is a very strange claim. Humans are subject to moral obligations, because they are the kind of creatures who can be. What grounds moral agency is simply different from what grounds moral standing as a patient. It is no more unfair that humans and not animals are moral agents, than it is unfair that real animals and not stuffed toys are moral patients. 

Sorry for the long quote. I thought Norcross could explain it better than I could (at least on the fly).

",cusrj9i,1441573763
cutww69,funwiththoughts,"There are two fundamental problems with the coma analogy.

Firstly, there is a self-interest reason for wanting coma patients to be moral patients. A conscious human can easily become a coma patient; most people, myself included, would want every attempt made to return them to full sentience in such a circumstance. There's no risk of my ever becoming a dog.

Secondly, coma patients don't need to kill each other to survive; many animals do. What should one do if one sees a lion attacking a gazelle? If the gazelle is a moral patient, then surely one has a duty to defend it. But by your standard, the lion is a moral patient too, and it needs to eat other moral patients to survive. Isn't it then immoral to stop it from doing so? What happens when one ""moral patient"" needs to cause another moral patient suffering in order to survive?",custbhe,1441671255
cuu1cxa,PanopticPoetics,"Hey, thanks for the thoughtful replies!

So, first thing, my responses here are merely my initial intuition, so try to take them as rough sketches of what could be a plausible defense. Second, neither of your criticisms are fundamental in any sort of way: even if your objections successfully localized a problem, the grounding of my positions would still stand (though perhaps the surface would need a slight tweak). They are pretty much surface level objections to apparent confounding implications. Third, only the second objection really has anything interesting to say, and so I will primarily concerned with that one. However, ultimately I think they both fail.

For your first objection, unlike what my post explicitly said not to do, you did: you got hung up on the analogy and did not address the ideas the analogy was meant to illustrate. I think you completely missed the point. The OP gave some properties, both in this case relational properties, of humans that animals lack or are deficient in (compared to humans, by human yard sticks) that are meant ground the moral status of humans and show why animals don‚Äôt get comparable status. The analogy was to show that we still give moral status to those humans that lack those properties, and thus those properties can‚Äôt be what ground‚Äôs the moral status of humans. I think that analogy suffices to show that, but if you are still hung up on it, pick a different one: children, fetuses (a very contentious one, but for many it works), the severely retarded, people from other parts of the world, and so on and on. Take your pick; they all lack those properties the OP proposed. You adding the property of ‚Äúself interest‚Äù does not change this: animals have ‚Äúself interests‚Äù too! That is the whole point of this debate! Ought we to give the interests of animals any moral weight?

Your second objection is more interesting and doesn‚Äôt hinge on just a poor interpretation like the last objection. What ought we to do when the interests of two (or more) moral patients conflict? What is our obligations as moral agents to the two moral patients? We recognize that we have these obligations, like to protect one from unnecessary harm and to promote their wellbeing at the very least, but in this case it seems like a state of affairs where we can only help one at the expense of the other: a true emergency. I think this is a difficult question, one that I doubt I can do justice for here. Nevertheless, I will sketch out one possible answer to it, though there might better answers. 

Well, what do we do when the interests of two or more humans conflict? We don‚Äôt just throw our hands up and say that all possible outcomes are equally immoral. One way to resolve this problem is to weigh conflicting interests. Ultimately one trumps the other. Let me give an example (though this one may be controversial). Say there was a drug that cured a specific cancer. Say some person need the drug to save the life of their child. This person exhausted all legal avenues to get the money to pay for it but couldn‚Äôt and the child will die very soon if they don‚Äôt get the drug. So this person steals the drug. I would argue that in this case the interest of the person and of the child for the child to live trumps the interests of the owner-of-the-drug‚Äôs economic interests (assuming the revenue from the drug was superfluous), and so stealing in this case was morally permissible. What is key here is that stealing here was *necessary* to secure a highly valued interests (an interest generally regarded as being of high intrinsic value).

Where does this leave us with the case of the lion and the gazelle, both in conflict, trying to secure the same interest to life? I suppose there is many ways we could go from here, but I will just mention a few. First, if we limited the scope of interest to just the two in direct conflict, perhaps the right thing to do is to do nothing. There is no reason to favor one over the other and both are doing what is necessary to secure their interest to life. Or perhaps, if we were to expand our scope of interests, and if lions were an endangered species, then it might be the right thing to let or help the lion kill the gazelle (ecologically). I don‚Äôt really know what is actually the right thing to do (at the moment), but I think it is a far stretch from saying that the conflict is unresolvable or that the moral framework necessarily leads to a contradiction. And further, we recognize that we are not making moral claims about the animals‚Äô actions, as they are only moral patients. Only moral agents can act moral or immoral (which could also suggest that there is no reason for us to intervene, since there would be no moral wrong to be guarded against here‚Äîif you want another way to look at it).

Now, how does this translate into the debate over humans using animals? Well, I think we still end up on the side that says that we shouldn‚Äôt use animals as a means to our ends. We ought to count the interest of animals, by being moral patients, as morally relevant. Our everyday oppression of animals in no way constitute a true emergency where we have to make such hard decisions. All our uses of animals for food, research, clothing, etc., are all unnecessary and often trivial‚Äîthis is demonstrably true. There is no conflict here.

cuuaxt4,funwiththoughts,"&gt;For your first objection, unlike what my post explicitly said not to do, you did: you got hung up on the analogy and did not address the ideas the analogy was meant to illustrate.

Your analogy was the only argument you made for those ideas; you are the one making a positive claim (killing animals is inherently wrong), so the burden of proof lies on you.

&gt;I think you completely missed the point. The OP gave some properties, both in this case relational properties, of humans that animals lack or are deficient in (compared to humans, by human yard sticks) that are meant ground the moral status of humans and show why animals don‚Äôt get comparable status.

Take your pick; they all lack those properties the OP proposed.

The severely retarded presents, again, an issue of self-interest; anyone could develop a debilitating mental illness.

I'm pro-choice, but that's a whole other debate.

I fail to see how people from any part of the world fit into this.

Children are more interesting, since one cannot become a child once one is an adult, but it seems clear that most children *above a certain age* are sentient, and we don't know exactly when that happens. We *could* make an arbitrary guess as to when a child becomes sentient, and say killing a child until that point is legal, but why bother? In this case, we (as a society) have already decided to err on the side of caution, and set the limit at birth, so why not keep doing as we are doing?

&gt; You adding the property of ‚Äúself interest‚Äù does not change this: animals have ‚Äúself interests‚Äù too! That is the whole point of this debate! Ought we to give the interests of animals any moral weight?

Animals have *interests*, sure, but *I* have no interest in them. When I say there is a *self-interest* in something, I mean that *I* have reasons to support it from a selfish perspective. This is present in the case of the coma patient, but not in the case of the animal.

&gt;Well, what do we do when the interests of two or more humans conflict? We don‚Äôt just throw our hands up and say that all possible outcomes are equally immoral. One way to resolve this problem is to weigh conflicting interests. Ultimately one trumps the other. Let me give an example (though this one may be controversial).

What is key here is that stealing here was necessary to secure a highly valued interests (an interest generally regarded as being of high intrinsic value).

The key difference here being that the theft will not continue to be necessary once the cancer is cured. The lion will always need to kill other animals to survive.

cutfbcs,[deleted],"Eh, there's plenty of other reasons someone could be against immigration. I'll try give a few:

**1) You might believe that the short-term economic burden is too great**

This point is probably the best one. Even if we all agreed that increasing immigration was good economic policy in the long term, no one argues that it is a good policy in the short term without certain circumstances. Unless those circumstances are met, it's entirely reasonable for some people to criticise the level of immigration, particularly unskilled immigration, into a country. An obvious example would be if a country had a serious unemployment problem, and a generous system of unemployment benefits. In the short term, too much immigration could easily send the country into a massive budget deficit, which is going to have long-term effects.

**2) You might have legitimate concerns about social cohesion that aren't racist in nature**

Almost everyone, if not everyone, agrees that tolerance can only extend so far (i.e. the idea of 'reasonable tolerance') before a society fails to function coherently. Modern, Western ideas about tolerance were formed after the Reformation, during the Wars of Religion, and this political climate has informed thought about the subject ever since: for the first time, European nations had to deal with minority groups that were unprecedentedly large and powerful. This eventually led to a great increase in the general level of religious freedom in Europe, but it initially completely destabilised the region and caused a great deal of death and suffering. Of course this is an overly dramatic example, but there's no reason to think that a large increase in membership to a certain minority group that is not well accepted couldn't create similar friction again, and to a lesser extent it does in many countries. Much like my first point, this is really a criticism of the rate of immigration in certain circumstances.

**3) It isn't in your personal best interest from an economic perspective**

This doesn't make them wrong. For point (3), it could be entirely reasonable to oppose computers out of self-interest. For point (1), you're being overly dramatic: it would be like supporting a temporary limit on the amount of jobs you could replace, and lowering it over time

&gt; Because a country is having problems doesn't mean that it is a good idea to turn away an economic boom.

There is very little evidence that immigration necessitates an economic *boom*, that's far too strong a claim.

So? This doesn't seem unreasonable. Regardless, it's a broader argument than that: it's not racist to disagree with groups of people on ethical, social or political issues necessarily.

Immigration has shown itself to be extremely similar in economic affects as new technologies that replace workers with more efficient systems. In most undergraduate economic textbooks they are taught together for this purpose!

My argument is that if you want to limit the citizenship of people you disagree with then you shouldn't be just against immigration but also want to limit the birth of people you could potentially disagree with in your own country.

Compare this to an influx of labor, in this case immigration.  An increase in labor just increases the *supply.*  Instead of shifting the labor supply curve, an increase in labor is just a movement along the supply curve, to a different point of supply and demand.

There's also arguably a better moral position against smoking than against overeating, as the external negatives of smoking (potential health effects of second hand smoke, the smell) are unavoidable if you are near a person who is smoking.

So just because divorce is up and marriage rates are historically low it doesn't mean we're not overall monogamous. I also doubt people would consider lusting after another to be a breach of a monogamous relationship (acting on those feelings would be, of course).

Personally I think humans are just plain diverse when it comes to relationships. We're complex people and when we group ourselves things get even more complex.

cuxyheg,Yxoque,"Here's my problem with views like this: Monogamy doesn't work for everyone. That doesn't mean that monogamy is bad, or failed. It just means that some people don't do well while monogamous. 

Think of it as a sexual orientation. Some people are straight, some people are gay, some people are bisexual. If being gay is seen as wrong or simply not presented as an option, a lot of bisexual people will be ""straight-by-default."" (e.g they either don't consider same-sex partners as an option or they choose not to have same-sex partners)

Some people are only happy in a monogamous relationship. Some people are only happy in polyamorous relationships. Some people are happy in either. The last group will default to monogamy if that is presented as the only acceptable option. 

So yes, polyamory of various kinds should be seen as a viable option for more people, but that doesn't devalue the experience of the people who are perfectly happy being monogamous.

&gt; Marriage rates are at an all time low (not necessarily a correlation, but I'm just pointing it out) and divorce rates are at an all time high. 

People who get a divorce still tend to be monogamous. They prefer having a single romantic and sexual partner. Getting divorced doesn't mean that you suck at being monogamous. It just means that you and your partner didn't work out in a monogamous relationship.

&gt; People always complain about how unhappy they are when they're married/in a long term relationship and how after the chemicals in your brain wear off - you start hating the other person and you get annoyed just by being around them.

This is extremely common in fiction and I wish it wasn't. Especially when it comes to men. It just doesn't match reality for a lot of people. Sure, the ""newly in-love"" chemicals wear off after a couple of months, but they get replaced by other chemicals that allow for a more stable, long-term love. A couple that communicates well probably won't start hating each other and won't get annoyed. Again, individual people breaking up for whatever reason does not devalue monogamy. Some people just aren't made for being together for a long time, but others are. Or the first also were, just not with each other.

Worth noting that about a century ago, the trope was reversed: People assumed that a couple with grow to love each other after marriage, even if they weren't in love when they got married.

&gt; Even when you are in those relationships - you lust for other people.

I personally don't, but that ultimately doesn't matter. I just want to point out that this isn't a universal experience.

There's also nothing wrong with lusting after other people, even if you are in a committed monogamous relationship. As long as you don't act on that lust (and this really shouldn't be that hard), everything's fine. 

&gt; Women want more and more ""alpha"" men to sleep with, men just want more women to sleep

The whole alpha thing is bullshit. And so is the idea that only men just want more women to sleep with. Women also sometimes just want to sleep with more men. People like sex. That shouldn't be a surprising statement. And again, this is not a universal experience. Tons of people are perfectly happy just having sex with one person ever. If you are not amongst those people, you probably shouldn't do monogamy.

&gt; you can't stop yourself from developing crushes or lusting over people that you find sexually attractive

So? Having a crush does not mean you can't remain in a dedicated monogamous relationship. It's not an impossible hurdle to overcome.

&gt;  In fact, every single relationship that I personally know has at least one person who is actively looking to replace the person they're with.

In every single relationship that I personally the people involved are looking to be together as much and as long as possible. Maybe you shouldn't use your personal circle to generalize a population. You tend to select friends with similar traits.

&gt; And people still tell you that marriage is wonderful and are shocked when they find out that you don't plan to get married. ""You'll grow out of it"" is the most popular response.

Yes. It's wrong for people to assume that all people are cut out for monogamy. Very annoying, I agree. That doesn't mean that for a lot of people, marriage *is* wonderful and fulfilling. Also, don't forget that polyamorous people can still get married. Currently only to one person, but it still happens (and people do have ceremonies to get married to multiple partners, even if they aren't official).

&gt; It seems like this system only works if you have a way to make sure both parties are unable to leave it and what's the point of pretending monogamy is ""real and beautiful"" when you need to actively force people to do it?

I really don't think this is the case. Monogamy, when done right, is real and beautiful. So is polyamory. People really don't need to be forced. Most people *want* to be in a relationship and if monogamy is the only option, they'll pick a monogamous relationship. The problem isn't monogamy. The probably monogamy being presented as the only viable option.

&gt; Is polygamy the answer?

Probably not. Polygamy means only men can have multiple (female) partners, which isn't ideal. What you want is a society that doesn't judge people on how many partners someone have, be it one partner or multiple.

That is not how masturbation feels, either circumcised or not. 

&gt;Read or at least skim this.[1]

I skimmed that article, then it occurred to me that circumcision.org is not the most unbiased source to be drawing opinions from. Psychology today is a pop science magazine, and I highly doubt Science Nordic is the goto resource on circumcision.

Most of your arguments are fine. *Cut penises are worse for sex.* I don't agree, but sure. There's a few other arguments you make which are curious.

&gt;Another problem with individuals with cut penises is premature ejaculation. The severe drop in nerve endings and huge rise in callused skin makes it hard to interpret sexual signals. In other cases, the lack of sensitivity could make it take forever to orgasm, leaving the woman with a raw vagina filled with thousands of micro cuts.

So it makes us premature and makes it take forever to orgasm all in one stroke? What you're talking about sounds like normal differentiation between different people, which has nothing at all to do with circumcision.

As for the HIV risk and cleaning, those don't even claim circumcision is bad, just that leaving it uncircumcised is ok too. To be honest, I don't see anything here about what makes circumcision so horrible, aside from minor issues during sex. And I say minor because a partner being too large/small is far more common an issue and takes more to deal with than anything you've outlined above. When we talk about genital mutilation, we're talking about fundamentally altering how someone is able to express and enjoy their sexuality. With circumcision we're largely talking about removing a flap.

I was partially circumcised at birth and didn't know I was any different than anyone else until I was say, 14 or 15. My emotional journey in dealing with that fact can be summed up with: ""Huh."" I do have some of my foreskin remaining, and about as much feeling in it as the loose skin on the tips of my elbows.

&gt;Cut men may realize deep down what they lost, but they will fight to the death to convince others themselves that they are perfect the way they are.

No, whether or not I have a spare skin flap does not resonate to my core, and you telling me it should is frankly insulting. Even though it's gone, it's my dickflap and neither you nor anybody else gets to tell me how to feel about it. I think most uncircumsized men would probably trade their foreskin for $250  if the process was quick, painless, and had no chance of mishap. 

To be honest, I don't think you've really talked to men on the topic. I know it can be an awkward topic, but talk to a friend or two about it. I think you would be very hard pressed to find a man who has suffered much at all emotionally from being circumcised, unless the circumcision was botched in some manner. Your opinion is that penises shouldn't be circumcised. That's fine, I actually tend to agree with you, and if we ever have kids (definitely not together) we will both gleefully do nothing about their flappy wee-wees. But painting people who choose otherwise as horrific genital mutilaters is unfair, uninformed, and blowing a minor issue *way* out of proportion.

I know you value sources, and since I tore most of yours apart I think it's only fair to post one of my own.

http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/08/27/159955340/pediatricians-decide-boys-are-better-off-circumcised-than-not

NPR is a nationally respected source of journalism. The conclusions they report are sourced from an actual medical journal, *Pediatrics*, not an incredibly biased website or pop publication whose purpose is to get pageviews, regardless of the facts.

I want to close by saying thank you. While I feel your opinion and the pieces of evidence that appear to support it are wrong, your intent is to right a perceived wrong, or at least to gain better understanding of it, and that is a noble aim. Especially since, lacking a penis, you have no implicit reason to care at all.

cv2pmya,sweetmercy,"Your stance comes from a position of ignorance of the topic you're taking a stance on. Losing weight is not simple, nor is it easy, especially for someone with exacerbating conditions such as thyroid problems, pernicious anemia, diabetes, heart disease, and eating disorders. Add to that, the more weight one has to lose, the more difficult it is to lose it and keep it off. In fact, permanent weight loss is fairly rare. The vast majority of people cannot lose weight and maintain that weight loss on their own when we're talking amounts of 100+ lbs. And it is not because they are lazy or unmotivated. It's a matter of biology. 80% of people who lose significant amounts of weight will gain it back, and often more than they lost. To presume it's laziness and lack of motivation is nothing more than a personal bigotry against obese people, and there is absolutely no truth to it. Are there some lazy obese people? Absolutely. But anyone who has lost that much weight hasn't done it by being lazy OR unmotivated. To think they have is just ignorant. 

To truly understand this, you need to learn from sources who aren't in the BUSINESS of weight loss. Those sources have a motivation to be dishonest and unrealistic. Learn from actual medical sources who aren't trying to profit off the obese. Actual scientists and doctors who are motivated by wanting people to be healthy. When someone who is severely obese loses weight, they have metabolic and hormonal changes that effectively sabotage them. No amount of motivation is going to make a difference in that biological reality. What's more, new research is showing that those changes aren't going away, even after a year or more. One of those hormones, Leptin, fell by 2/3 or more after weight loss. Leptin tells the brain how much body fat is present. When that hormone falls, the metabolism slows and appetite increases because the body thinks it needs to store *more fat*. In the studies, the leptin levels remained low a year after the weight loss, and only rose as the participants regained their weight. 

And that's just one way in which the body self-sabotages. 

Unless it is your body, it is not for you to judge if surgery is a viable option. Even so, if you want to have an opinion about it, the least you could do is shed some of your ignorance on the matter by educating yourself. Are you aware, for example, of everything a patient has to go through *before* they're even allowed to undergo such a surgery? They have to spend at least a year (usually closer to 18 months-2 years) trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, for one thing. These are NOT unmotivated people. Television and the media may portray weight loss surgery as a quick fix, but it's no picnic, it isn't easy at all. Your entire life changes when you have it. Your body reacts differently to everything. Your skin changes, your tastes change, there's emotional and mental tolls on the patient. It is NOT an easy, quick fix that just sheds the weight and makes life easy. 

People who undergo this surgery HAVE done the eating less/moving more route. It wasn't enough. It isn't always enough, no matter what the reddit circlejerk says.",,1442347521
cv2r6nq,maotzu,"Ahem, I'll just leave this scientific study here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8077323

Restricting calories works, whether other health problems are present or not. It is not ""weight loss business"", it is science. Eating less food isn't a very difficult thing to do. Everyone is capable of eating less. In fact, caloric restriction and proper dieting increases leptin sensitivity in obese patients. 

Here is another study for your pleasure: http://www.biochem.arizona.edu/classes/bioc462/462bh2008/462bhonorsprojects/462bhonors2006/warzeckas/caloric%20restriction%20reverses%20leptin%20receptor%20deficit.pdf

I am aware of what a patient goes through before their surgery and I can assure you it is not 1-2 years of closely monitored caloric restriction. It is the patient telling the doctor ""I've tried to lose weight but couldn't"". Improper measuring and calorie counting will sabotage weight loss but it is very possible for someone who measures and counts properly to lose weight.

Everyone can do it. It doesn't require surgery. It requires lifestyle change. http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/10164678/wheelchair-user-130lbs-healthier",cv2pmya,1442349744

They don't have flashy jobs but run businesses that are ""economy proof"" providing essential services. And they don't lead flashy lifestyles, but live in modest houses, drive modest vehicles, and so forth.

I suspect that in working in estate planning you are far more likely to encounter wealthy people who have complicated and flashy holdings hence the need for planning, whereas the average millionaire doesn't really need any more than a simple will because their estate won't be much different than the every man's, just with some higher numbers on the accounts.

But others feel sexuality for other reasons and a complete lack of sexuality in the absence of those other reasons.  I can't claim to *know* this to be true.

Also that is one organization they don't speak for every rape victim ",cv8a9xe,1442783578
cv8bnsy,Keep-reefer-illegal,"Most accusations are true, most people just never come forward, when you read victimization surveys way more people come forward about being raped than people reporting it. 

The sense of I'll get away gives rapists more power, rape is about power not sex. 

It is still innocent until proven guilty under the law, but we aren't discussing law we are discussing culture

cv8irqg,stewshi,"Historically minorities have been able to show their value to their nation and show their love for their nation by serving bravely and loyally in the armed forces. This allows them to show that they are contributing to the nation that they want to change. So it would hurt their causes if women and homosexuals were to abandon what is considered a noble and honorable pursuit. It would allow bigots to say if you won't fight for this country why should this country change rule x for you.Also the military offers a way of extreme economic and social mobility without the need for a college degree. Your able to prove yourself by the sweat of your brow. Also to say that the military is solely a tool of destruction is partially correct but the military is also used as a tool of good will for national disasters. Also the army Corp of engineers are in charge of maintaining a portion of the nation's wetlands. The army went and helped in Haiti, new Orleans, nepal, and many other natural disasters.


Edit 
Also the US military is the sole defender of women's rights in afghanistan. So they definitely defend that and other human rights like we defend minority groups while we were in Iraq and in afghanistan ",,1442796814
cv8jly3,stewshi,"Spent 8 years in the army been to Iraq and Afghanistan definitely not a mindless serial killer. You are sterotyping an organization that is made up of thousands of people. The army has about 1 percent of its force as fighters , about the same for the Marines, a super small amount for the navy and even smaller for the airforce. These groups have incredibly complex tasks that involve winning over foreign occupied people. Also the stereotypes of mindless follower is wrong when the reality of it is that you are expected to make drastic decisions in the absence of orders. Many of them have made the decision for them selves that killing in defence of their nations, and it's interests is justified. Their are others who want the college benefits offered by the military, the steady career, or a better lifestyle for themselves and their families. You have an overly simplistic view of the military and the men and women that make it work. It isn't meant to be a progressive force of the left it is meant to be the nation's strength and when minorities join it the legitimize their causes by saying they are willing to get their hands dirty for they country. Your view that no progressive should support war at any cost you'll have to think that a invasion could have prevented the genocide in rawanda and military intervention did halt the genocide in the balkans.",cv8ixzm,1442798268
cv8k5po,stewshi,"So if in the process of killing isis would I not be protecting the human rights of the women being raped by isis, the gay men being executed, all of the people being persecuted and sold into slavery. Or is all the good that would come from killing one isis member would be negated by the act of taking a vicious oppressors life. Fighting off a regressive oppressive force is progress. Fighting people that commit horrible atrocities, that broadcast such atrocities across the Internet is progress. To not allow women and gays to take part in that because they would kill someone is not progress. That is supporting a horrible status quo in a misguided attempt as being a pacifist. The ss wasn't stopped by saying pretty please. The Japanese atrocities in mainland Asia weren't stopped by saying pretty please. The religious police of the taliban weren't stopped by saying pretty please. Isis won't be stopped by saying pretty please. Also killing a combatant in war is not murder it is killing because both people are willing participants. Killing a civilian is murder but exceptions are made for accidents. These exceptions also have very narrow guidelines so contrary to your belief that every service member wakes up and shoots a baby it just not true that they are all murders. Also you say equality at the cost of human rights is not progress were can you show evidence that the people that we are at war with lost human rights. ",cv8jr5u,1442799186

Freedom of speech exceptions in the US can essentially be boiled down to two categories; lewd behavior/corruption of a minor and expressing intent to commit a crime/trying to incite another person into committing a crime.

Holistically speaking there are very few other countries, if any, that have the level of protection to express an *idea or a thought* that the US has.  I could draw a cartoon of our most powerful leaders getting ass fucked by a donkey and the government will protect my right to do that. I have the right to write a book about how every [insert protected class here] person is useless and they should all die, and that right will be protected. I have the right to go on facebook and call a random girl a dirty disgusting whore and the government will protect that right. As long as I don't directly state an intention to commit a crime then I basically have the right to express every damn isea that pops into my head. I don't believe that there is any other country on earth that would afford me that right. The United States government will let me say anything I want without fear of government persecution.
