Learning to live together has caused decades, if not centuries, of unrest in the US (where I'm from).

They're working hard, putting money into the economy for their and their children's future, such as education and social services.

The issue here, I think, is sentience.  If something is sentient it's wrong to kill it, if not, well it's just a bug.

If this had been some drunk asshole making noise, no one would have a problem with people telling him to shut up, or get out. If it was someone talking on a cellphone, I'm sure this actor's facebook post would've had a much different tone.

Being a parent means that sometimes, you're going to miss out on things because of your kids, being the parent of a special needs child that much more, but that doesn't change the fact that it's your responsibility as a parent to know ahead of time what your kids can or cannot handle, and to then plan accordingly. If you take it upon yourself to say: ""Fuck everyone else, I'll take my kid where I want and they'll just have to deal"", then that's your prerogative, but in doing so you forfeit the right to complain/be offended when people tell you to control your kid, or get the fuck out.",cvfy5sk,1443382570

cvozz5a,klw,"&gt;Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.

I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions:

1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

2.  It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra.

3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.

4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

&gt;Formal guidelines on reporting suicide have since been adopted for journalists in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, and Hong Kong.

cw50tk0,alanforr,"&gt; 2/3 of gun homicides in America are suicides.
&gt;
&gt; So it's clear that at least 2/3 of gun homicides are mental health issues; if the suicidal person had proper mental health treatment, they likely would have been able to overcome their suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

When a person commits suicide he does so because he sees it as a solution to his problems. For example, if he has a lot of debt that he doesn't know how to repay, his creditors won't be able to hound if he is dead. Or if he wants sex but no woman will touch him, then he may prefer death to living alone.

A person does not commit suicide because of a fault in his body. Suicide isn't like an epileptic fit. It requires taking deliberate actions. In this particular context, suicide requires finding a gun, picking it up and then putting it to some part of your body and pulling the trigger. This action is not an accident, or a twitch, or a fit; it is a choice.

If you're saying you want to prevent a person from making that choice you have a moral disagreement with him: that is not a medical issue. If you are saying the person should be ""treated"", then you are advocating offering him some option that you see as helpful. This is also a moral issue.

Some people will turn down such help if it is offered. If, as is common today, such a person is told that he has no choice and will be locked up in a mental hospital without trial, and with no hope of release except at the whim of psychiatrists, then you are advocating reducing that person to a rightless lump that you can dispose of as you see fit. Your position implies that such a person has no right to control his life or death. And if he attempts to take control over his own death he will be punished: you will inflict something on him that he does not want. This is a legal and moral issue.

A person who commits mass murder also takes deliberate actions to do so. This is a result of values, not some fault with his body. This person has made a choice to murder a load of people. How this person should be treated is a moral and legal issue, not a medical issue.

If your suggestion is to offer people who are having a hard time sympathy, or advice, or drugs or whatever, you should say that clearly. If your proposal is to inflict sympathy, or advice, or drugs on people having a hard time without their consent, then you should say that clearly.

cw5ilg6,alanforr,"There is not overwhelming evidence to refute my claim. There is no way to detect mental illnesses solely by testing the chemical and structural properties of the body.

And it's also not the case that there is a test that can be done during autopsy looking at brain structure to determine whether the person was mentally ill. There is no evidence that mental illness is a result of faults in the body. As a result the fact that people who commit suicide were diagnosed as mentally ill provides no evidence that it is a medical problem.

And it would be surprising if there was such evidence. There is more to life then whether your body happens to be working properly.

I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing.

Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)).

Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. 

Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it.

&gt;Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face.

The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.

Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B.

You just sealed OP's point, they aren't outraged by black on black crime. They aren't drawing any attention to it and that's the point, that's why it is misguided. Police shootings is a much smaller problem than black on black crime and there is absolutely no focus of any sort on it. If they really cared about the deaths of blacks, they would focus on the largest problem in addition to police shootings. But they don't, they never discuss it, and if people even bring it up an argument starts about it rather than admitting it is even an issue.

cxol4td,sumnihil,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso

&gt;It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain

Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. 

* Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially

* Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy.

* Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them.

The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them.

I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking.

&gt; I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them

Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche.

I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit.

I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. 

I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good.

The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior. ",,1449362089
cxrmq9w,geminia999,"&gt;  For example even though each politician as an individual might be a good person and willing to work for the common good, when they are inside a bipartisan elective system in which corruption is legal, their good intentions do not matter that much. You could replace all the individuals within the political system and it wouldn't really change the situation on the long term (same causes, same effects).

Would you say it's okay to say that an individual good person is considered at fault for being in such a system (especially if it was at a system where they had no choice to be considered a member of)?

It seems you are somewhat unfamiliar with the situation going on (or so I assume from how you write) so I can't necessarily give a good or unbiased summary, but I do personally see some stuff like that quite a bit in regards to social justice. That a white person is considered inherently racist for being into a system that is considered racist.

While I may agree a huge overhaul of a system may be required, there is quite a bit of blame and animosity put towards the people that form such a system and I don't see that as being much better.",cxrlsqi,1449591512
cxroe1y,geminia999,"&gt; That is done in two ways: by highlighting the ways in which identity generates unfavorable treatment for unprivileged groups, and by highlighting the way identity generates favorable treatment for privileged groups.

And where exactly is the middle ground, the default? Privileged people are treated unfairly beneficially, and unprivileged people are disadvantaged. Where is the group that is neither unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged? What is the base level of human treatment that is not unfair?

That's a big part of my issue is that there really is no room for a base treatment, if someone is treated somewhat better, everyone else is now unprivileged in comparison. There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups? That there are people who are chosen because of their identity, privileged, people not chosen because of their identity, unprivileged, and those who are chosen/not chosen not due to identity, default or neutral. By conflating groups the first and last groups you just seem to making bigger issues and suggests that the solution is something entirely different.

Sorry, but if the discussion on privilege refuses to recognize that concept, I have to say it's designed to pit two groups against each other and create animosity rather than cooperation.

&gt;It's not about revenge - it's about acknowledgement.

May I ask how ""punching up"" and ""Male tears"" are exactly acknowledgement? 

Don't you feel that constant language such as oppressors and privilege are going to make people get upset at these groups and associate them with such terms negatively? Even if it isn't about revenge in it's base concept, it certainly seems to be breeding a lot of hostility and anger through how it chooses to get across it's message. ""These people don't deserve to be treated better than us, they oppress us. they hurt us!"" It certainly creates an attitude among people that could be pretty easy to get lost in don't you agree?

&gt;That's why you'll certainly see discussion of privilege, but the highest levels of frustration with unexamined privilege. Too many members of privileged groups (the same groups that hold social, political, and economic power) either don't see or refuse to acknowledge the way privilege affects their life.

And just a personal gripe, but that's part of my own issue with the movement, they only care for some privileges. How many people who prominently do end up supporting Social Justice end up being from some pretty rich backgrounds (see for example, the man who did the hunger strike recently, who is the son of a multi-millionaire), yet seemingly ignore wealth as a privilege. It seems so common a phrase to say ""those who have privilege can't see it"" but they never seem to take that mean that they should potentially direct the lens back at themselves. I mean, in regards to issues with women, do you ever see female privilege as an idea ever pop up?

I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving.

Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens.

Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility.

I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value!

&gt;Around 10% of people in a US survey said they had been the victim of a false accusation of sexual abuse, child abuse or domestic violence.

These are self reported results from an admittedly biased source. They should be taken with a healthy heap of salt. This isn't using any kind of legal standard for false accusations, nor does it seem to clarify that these accusations were made in a legal context. The only peer reviewed study I've seen int this pegged the rate at somewhere between 3 and 8% might be false accusations.

&gt;But even if we assume that the impact of a false accusation is only half as bad as a sexual assault, when combined with the sexual assaults perpetrated by women against males the total harm caused by women to men through these crimes is greater than that caused by the reverse.

This assumes a whole lot of things. First and foremost, it assumes that men never accuse women falsely. It also makes a bunch of weird assumptions about the impact of crimes. Its impossible to quantify how ""bad"" a sexual assault will be on the victim. Some people shrug it off, others will have panic attacks for years. It depends. ANd I think you're vastly overstating the impact of false accusations. The duke lacrosse players are all doing quite well for themselves now, despite a hugely publicized case.

You also seem to think that there's this epidemic of false accusers putting men in prison. I don't know that I know of any cases where this happens. Most of the time they are acquitted, take a hit in public image (which I'm not minimizing, it can be harmful) and things move forward.

&gt;Men who are known to rape and abuse women are rightly punished and vilified but women who commit similar crimes against men are not.

Really? You don't think women to go jail for sexual assault? There's the recent story about the woman accused of raping her student. I very much hope and expect that she'll see jailtime.


&gt;Few people will admit that they are happy for rape and other crimes of comparable impact to go unpunished so long as the perpetrator is female and the victim male, but it is clear from their actions that most people have no problem with the current situation. 

Are you sure? I've seen the same articles about the female rapist posted in /r/MensRights and /r/TwoXChromosomes about this case.

&gt; but that is only the level of favouritism (roughly 10% of the punishment that the other gender gets) that exists for women in our current society.

What would it take to convince you that this is a gross exaggeration?

Men who are known to rape and abuse women are rightly punished and vilified but women who commit similar crimes against men are not. The 'average' feminist position (and I acknowledge that not all of them agree) is that this situation needs to favour women a lot more than it already does (for example, feminists are campaigning to make it easier and more damaging to accuse a man of rape and *for fewer women to be imprisoned)*.

Feminist groups generally take a hostile attitude to groups which talk about discrimination against men. Therefore feminists in general are advocating for the treatment of female criminals to be better than it already is. One type of criminal is rapists. I've never seen a feminist group which specifically calls for action against female rapists as opposed to rapists in general.

Yes, sure you are. Every men's issue is totally a concern for feminists when their failure to address them is rubbed in their faces by anti-feminists.

I like the way you are 'against the prison complex' rather than the discrimination. So we should be sending fewer people to prison in general? Of course, when an issue mostly affects women, feminists make sure that all the support is given to women. When it mostly affect men, then it's time to treat *everyone* better.

And throughout this nation's history the powers that be have convinced blacks, poor whites, and others at the bottom of society that to scapegoat and compete with each other instead of seeing that the true cause of their problems is those at the top of society.  For example the very first [anti-miscengenation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States#Colonial_Era) laws were passed before America was even founded as a country.

Blacks are living proof that a group of people's status can change over time and the issue of citizenship is a highly racial issue.  Why is it different for Latin Immigrants?

&gt;He wants Russian hackers to attack Hillary Clinton.

They'd be just as dangerous in power and they stand up for minorities who are black, women and mexican. Nobody else.

They'll only help and FEEL offended for you if you're skin color is a certain color AND your beliefs are just like theres.

So when you say ""western culture"" what you actually mean is YOUR value set TODAY which is not at all reflective of what ""average western culture over the last 60 years"" is/was.

On what do you base this claim?  If it was untrue would that be enough to change your view?

Also I think today's extreme right is a child of today's extreme left - and it is important to understand that it only has the power it has because of mistakes on the part of the left.

For example: If someone is accused of being a racist for the use of perfectly accurate phrases such as ""illegal immigrant"", and ""All Lives Matter"", or taking the perfectly reasonable position that international borders should be enforced, there is very little incentive for people to pay attention to claims of racism from the left.  Or object to the orwellian term ""safe spaces"".  

The left burned a huge amount of its credibility by pushing for the prosecution of cake makers who don't like homosexuals, and politicians who ""deny"" climate change, and university students who said something stupid, or university professors who dared to teach uncomfortable truths.

However, I still want it. I don't want to be considered garbage and with the group of people who never achieve anything (positive) in the world. The simple fact is, even if MANY people have unwarranted positive recognition (like most celebrities, IMO), they still have massive influence over others to change things. ""Average"" people literally have no influence and are not seen as useful to anyone or anything (unless they are also equally average and insignificant). They cannot achieve a single useful thing in the world and are just resource takers. 

Yes, I know undoubtedly I am not an ""average"" person on the inside. But to be looked at so lowly by others means I will never be able to influence the world for the better. ""Below-Average"" people are in the same boat of power and influence as ""average"" people: they have none at all.

Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them.

Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option.

d86k1c6,VladTheRemover,"1. Race is absolutely not an invented concept. There are measurable differences in brain size, skull shape, bone density, hormone levels, gestation, height, admixture of other hominid species, IQ, teeth, infant development, on and on and on. These differences are largely glossed over because the argument is, ""orange exists therefore red and yellow do not."" Science hasn't decided yet how much the admixture of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA affects populations (Africans have none) but I think it may be significant even if it only comprises 3% or so. 

2. Ok, so let's say the only special thing about white people is there ability to withstand the harsh winters of Europe and ice age Europe, specifically that these environmental pressures pushed natural selection into a different direction. Winter means one thing first and foremost, future planning. If you do not store enough food to survive the winter you die. If you say, ""fuck it"" and eat your seed crop or breeding pair of animals you die. If you do not cooperate and help other members of your tribe you die. If your winter was particularly harsh and half your tribe died it would be advantageous to merge with one or more neighbors. Future planning. Delayed gratification. Cooperation. All bred in by natural pressures that do not exist in Africa. 

3. Multiculturalism has been found empirically to degrade communities. It erodes civic participation, charity, voting, trust, and basically all the things that make communes ""nice"". I will find the study for you shortly. Furthermore these ""movements"" to overthrow so called ""oppressive"" white regimes universally lead to shitholes from once prosperous places. South Africa, Rhodesia, Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, etc. I defy you to come up with a single example of an increased non white population or increased non white control over government demonstrably improved quality of life. One of the big complaints against colonialism is, ""we forced different peoples to exist as one country! How could that possibly work!"" Yet when it's a white neighborhood country, or continent overrun it's ""diversity"". Furthermore mixed race children have more health problems, both mentally and physically and are more likely to end up in prison. Also over 90% http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2015/10/study-claims-92-of-biracial-children-with-black-dads-are-born-out-of-wedlock/ of white/black children born to white mothers are born as bastards out of wedlock and a large majority of those are abandoned by the fathers often before birth. 82% end up on welfare. The flip side of that coin is that WM/BF marriages are by far the most stable, even more stable than Asian/Asian or white/white marriages by far, even though BM/WF are 200% (!) more likely to end in divorce than white/white.  Finally the most homogenously white countries/communities have the highest standard of living (think Nordic countries, Australia, New Zealand, etc.)

Long story short on why I am proud of my race is I stopped letting people guilt me into not being proud. Look around you. Basically everything of value was invented by whites. Sure there are exceptions, but the vast majority of the modern world was made by white men. White men partook in a crusade to end slavery all over the world, a practice as old as time and practiced by every race of people yet we are the only ones blamed for it. By colonizing the world we put an end to the savagery of indigenous populations and brought them medicine, reading, and other modern advantages. No one talks about it anymore but the barbaric natives of the world absolutely needed a firm hand. The new world was full of human sacrifice, murilation, canabalism, constant tribal war, etc. Africa was full of just the most horrible shit you can imagine (and it's back with a vengeance now that whites were kicked out). The Muslim world was the slavery capital of the world yet they don't have a sizable black population today. Why? Because they castrated most of the men and didn't breed with the black sex slaves, often resorting to infanticide. Pacific islands were full of canibalism and human sacrifice. Australians were fond of extremely casual infanticide. As in ""I'll jam this kids head in an animal burrow and get it stuck because it can't keep up on this hike."" 

You have been pounded and pounded with self hatred and guilting tactics since you were a child. Why? Ask yourself that question, then look at the accomplishments of the white man and ask if it's warranted.  Other cultures don't practice the culture of critique. They do not beat their children over the head with their forefathers actions modernity frowns upon while ignoring and downplaying the staggering accomplishments of the same forefathers. Do you think Muslim kids are guilted over their constant invasions, sex slave raids, and constant warlording/savagery? Do you think South American kids are shamed because their forefathers liked to cut out beating human hearts? Do you think Polynesian kids are made to hate themselves for their forefathers canabalism? Do you think Indian kids are made to feel bad for the practice of widow burning? Never.

To suggest that Black communities continue to struggle because of past racism is to suggest that Blacks are somehow so much worse than these other groups who have all been enslaved and oppressed. To suggest that they need assistance is patently racist, and it seems to be the prevailing narrative.

Let's not kid ourselves here. If you want to talk about people as a whole and not yourself, then accept the fact that the rich do not give as charitably as you think. A household making $50,000 or less actually gives MORE of their wealth as a percentage of income than the rich do.

https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/548537/

If the rich were all such altruistic charitable folk, then I would never dream of trying to create some sort of system to force them to stop being such selfish assholes. But the facts are clear: most rich people have zero interest in doing what you're doing. Most will hoard that money for generations while the sick and the hungry continue to die needlessly.

Honestly I don't give an iota of a shit what happens to the economy or how difficult this is to implement.

e0x0038,xZenox,"I will not attempt to change your view regarding socialism because I agree with your position  even though it seems like you hold it because of a hunch. I will however challenge two major errors in your description:

----

&gt;I am surprised though that **there are economies with socialism and they seem to be going alright**, however I don't know how far they go down the Socialist rabbit hole.

There are no socialist countries with efficient economies and high living standards. The so called ""socialist"" countries of Scandinavia have one of the most capitalist economies in the world, although the extent of regulation and legal system make it technically a ""mixed economy"" which is mostly a political term because in economics a ""mixed economy"" is anything between centrally planned economy and the free market - and that is a very broad spectrum.   In fact Sweden has attempted to introduce more socialism through slow reform but by the early 80s it mostly run itself into a standstill, had to re-tract reform and having engaged in extensive money creation suffered a monetary crisis in mid 90s.  

The reason why those countries are called ""socialist"" comes from the fact that socialism is, always has been, and most likely will be a political movement primarily - that is an ideology designed to attract and control people in a way that puts the leaders of the political movement in power i.e. allows them to live at everyone's expense. This is why a socialist party in Sweden is telling everyone that socialism is working because they hope to receive constant support so they can continue their parasitic existence.  Same naturally can be said about a ""conservative"" party that exists in a country with extensive welfare and majority of the Communist Manifesto put into action - which is most countries in the west.

There is no way to debate any political ideas without addressing the fundamental ugly truth. All politics is the art of successful lying to people to control them so that you can use the resources at their disposal. Never has been anything else. The ""governance"" that results is mostly accidental.

-----

&gt; I am seeing the post-AI introduction future being brought up a lot in the thread. **I do see some potential in that** (I'm still not sold however) but still haven't had much really change my opinion.

There is zero potential in AI-managed socialism. To understand that you need to understand what socialism is and what it isn't.

Socialism broadly speaking assumes a planned economy, by which the socialists mean an economy that doesn't use the ""capitalist"" method of planning i.e. the price system. It most typically assumes a system of assigned quotas of production in different forms.   But it also assumes a fundamentally *human* society living within the structure of that system.

Such system has no ability to properly process the information that is mediated by the price system and the markets and therefore leads to economic shortages which in turn lead to social unrest and require a repressive state to keep the population under control. This is the real reason for the tyrannical nature of socialism which was not envisioned by socialist theorists - they only envisioned resistance of capitalists, but not the utter failure of their creation which led to economic collapse and unrest and required the state to repress the population to remain in control.

AI is suggested as the answer to those problems by providing the necessary computing capability to manage the planning.  However the goal is also to provide planning capability with such efficacy that *no repression against the population is required*.  That means that the planning must be at least able to simulate existing markets (let's leave the ability to exceed them for other time) and I can assure you that it is far more complex than the most complex weather simulation for which current supercomputers are built and requires constant input of accurate data which is far in excess of what current networks combined can provide.  

In other words the AI capable of simulating the market would require a technological advancement of such level that any notion of keeping a *socialist* economy - that is an economy where humans have a participatory role, even as ""owners"" - is rendered absurd. If you understand that to simulate the existing markets in the simplest fashion possible you need to create a simulation of human economy today you will understand that it will result in a human-like consciousness (or quasi-consciousness, let's leave it for another time) that will be in control of all productive capacity as well as managing the flow of information. 

This will lead to a parallel ""humanity"" that will have the purpose of serving us based on exactly the same amount of resources. 

This is human extinction as an existential necessity because those two parallel humanities become direct competitors.

From the position of the AI it would be completely unproductive to do anything else but provide basic living standards as a form of welfare until such extinction is complete if the AI is empathetic to humanity. If not then there are more efficient ways to get rid of us as an existential threat.

In short-  any form of socialism is meaningless in an AI era and talks of post-scarcity in human society are nothing else but reflections of ignorance and lack of understanding on the part of proponents.  Interestingly it is not the theoretical economic model that fails here - this is purely computation. It is the logic of implementing the model. It literally requires the creation of a ""new man"" which will supersede the ""old man"". I just don't think that this was what Marx had in mind.

In fact there is nothing more incorrect than to continue to apply 19th century ideas to 21st century economy slowly closing in on the ""singularity"".   But like I said earlier socialism is primarily about ideologues looking for ways to help themselves into power and for believers looking for narratives which match their life circumstances - which is all of politics.

The discussion of any future ""socialist"" or ""post-scarcity"" economics is futile as it should completely reconsider the fundamental principle of what it means to be a ""society"" with such capacity. There the scenarios are several, require some understanding of evolution, technology and economics and a large dose of anti-anxiety medication because the future is very alien and fairly bleak for us - old fashioned humans. Adapt or go extinct. Sorry.

However that doesn't mean that some of ideas that also exist within the socialist structure can't be implemented. In particular - the notion of common ownership (in this instance, lack of it) with regards to fundamental so called ""intellectual property"" should (in fact must) be considered. Otherwise we are building a dreadful tyranny.

So socialism as the socialist imagine it - not or definitely not. Select elements of it with proper adjustment - yes or probably yes.

As a parting note I'd like to mention that unlike most (99,99%) of redditors I have lived in a socialist country and have background in economics. I did not want to start with that for fairness' sake.

Car driving is risky, but is it more risky than leaving your child in a car unattended?  Hard to say, because we don't have good numbers on ""left my child unattended in a car, everything was fine"".

Do you have any evidence that illegal immigrants are mostly homeless? Oh what's that? Almost all of them live in houses? Yeah, they are contributing to that problem then. 

&gt;1) bad building regulations, and 2) not enough houses being built.

That is correct. But that doesn't change the fact that adding more demand for the existing limited supply will further increase the problem. Until current citizens and legal residents have been sorted, illegal immigrants need to be restricted from contributing to that increase in demand. 

&gt;why does everyone ignore the fundamentally overwhelming evidence that illegal immigrants are net positives for the economy?

Because that evidence doesn't exist. It's a very mixed bag, AT BEST. If you have such evidence, I would suggest submitting it to a peer-reviewed journal and winning yourself a Nobel prize. ",e19o9tf,1529945707
