Learning to live together has caused decades, if not centuries, of unrest in the US (where I'm from).

They're working hard, putting money into the economy for their and their children's future, such as education and social services.

The issue here, I think, is sentience.  If something is sentient it's wrong to kill it, if not, well it's just a bug.

If this had been some drunk asshole making noise, no one would have a problem with people telling him to shut up, or get out. If it was someone talking on a cellphone, I'm sure this actor's facebook post would've had a much different tone.

Being a parent means that sometimes, you're going to miss out on things because of your kids, being the parent of a special needs child that much more, but that doesn't change the fact that it's your responsibility as a parent to know ahead of time what your kids can or cannot handle, and to then plan accordingly. If you take it upon yourself to say: ""Fuck everyone else, I'll take my kid where I want and they'll just have to deal"", then that's your prerogative, but in doing so you forfeit the right to complain/be offended when people tell you to control your kid, or get the fuck out.",cvfy5sk,1443382570

cvozz5a,klw,"&gt;Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.

I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions:

1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

2.  It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra.

3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.

4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

&gt;Formal guidelines on reporting suicide have since been adopted for journalists in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, and Hong Kong.

cw50tk0,alanforr,"&gt; 2/3 of gun homicides in America are suicides.
&gt;
&gt; So it's clear that at least 2/3 of gun homicides are mental health issues; if the suicidal person had proper mental health treatment, they likely would have been able to overcome their suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

When a person commits suicide he does so because he sees it as a solution to his problems. For example, if he has a lot of debt that he doesn't know how to repay, his creditors won't be able to hound if he is dead. Or if he wants sex but no woman will touch him, then he may prefer death to living alone.

A person does not commit suicide because of a fault in his body. Suicide isn't like an epileptic fit. It requires taking deliberate actions. In this particular context, suicide requires finding a gun, picking it up and then putting it to some part of your body and pulling the trigger. This action is not an accident, or a twitch, or a fit; it is a choice.

If you're saying you want to prevent a person from making that choice you have a moral disagreement with him: that is not a medical issue. If you are saying the person should be ""treated"", then you are advocating offering him some option that you see as helpful. This is also a moral issue.

Some people will turn down such help if it is offered. If, as is common today, such a person is told that he has no choice and will be locked up in a mental hospital without trial, and with no hope of release except at the whim of psychiatrists, then you are advocating reducing that person to a rightless lump that you can dispose of as you see fit. Your position implies that such a person has no right to control his life or death. And if he attempts to take control over his own death he will be punished: you will inflict something on him that he does not want. This is a legal and moral issue.

A person who commits mass murder also takes deliberate actions to do so. This is a result of values, not some fault with his body. This person has made a choice to murder a load of people. How this person should be treated is a moral and legal issue, not a medical issue.

If your suggestion is to offer people who are having a hard time sympathy, or advice, or drugs or whatever, you should say that clearly. If your proposal is to inflict sympathy, or advice, or drugs on people having a hard time without their consent, then you should say that clearly.

cw5ilg6,alanforr,"There is not overwhelming evidence to refute my claim. There is no way to detect mental illnesses solely by testing the chemical and structural properties of the body.

And it's also not the case that there is a test that can be done during autopsy looking at brain structure to determine whether the person was mentally ill. There is no evidence that mental illness is a result of faults in the body. As a result the fact that people who commit suicide were diagnosed as mentally ill provides no evidence that it is a medical problem.

And it would be surprising if there was such evidence. There is more to life then whether your body happens to be working properly.

I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing.

Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)).

Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. 

Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it.

&gt;Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face.

The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.

Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B.

You just sealed OP's point, they aren't outraged by black on black crime. They aren't drawing any attention to it and that's the point, that's why it is misguided. Police shootings is a much smaller problem than black on black crime and there is absolutely no focus of any sort on it. If they really cared about the deaths of blacks, they would focus on the largest problem in addition to police shootings. But they don't, they never discuss it, and if people even bring it up an argument starts about it rather than admitting it is even an issue.

cxol4td,sumnihil,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso

&gt;It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain

Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. 

* Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially

* Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy.

* Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them.

The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them.

I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking.

&gt; I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them

Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche.

I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit.

I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. 

I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good.

The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior. ",,1449362089
cxrmq9w,geminia999,"&gt;  For example even though each politician as an individual might be a good person and willing to work for the common good, when they are inside a bipartisan elective system in which corruption is legal, their good intentions do not matter that much. You could replace all the individuals within the political system and it wouldn't really change the situation on the long term (same causes, same effects).

Would you say it's okay to say that an individual good person is considered at fault for being in such a system (especially if it was at a system where they had no choice to be considered a member of)?

It seems you are somewhat unfamiliar with the situation going on (or so I assume from how you write) so I can't necessarily give a good or unbiased summary, but I do personally see some stuff like that quite a bit in regards to social justice. That a white person is considered inherently racist for being into a system that is considered racist.

While I may agree a huge overhaul of a system may be required, there is quite a bit of blame and animosity put towards the people that form such a system and I don't see that as being much better.",cxrlsqi,1449591512
cxroe1y,geminia999,"&gt; That is done in two ways: by highlighting the ways in which identity generates unfavorable treatment for unprivileged groups, and by highlighting the way identity generates favorable treatment for privileged groups.

And where exactly is the middle ground, the default? Privileged people are treated unfairly beneficially, and unprivileged people are disadvantaged. Where is the group that is neither unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged? What is the base level of human treatment that is not unfair?

That's a big part of my issue is that there really is no room for a base treatment, if someone is treated somewhat better, everyone else is now unprivileged in comparison. There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups? That there are people who are chosen because of their identity, privileged, people not chosen because of their identity, unprivileged, and those who are chosen/not chosen not due to identity, default or neutral. By conflating groups the first and last groups you just seem to making bigger issues and suggests that the solution is something entirely different.

Sorry, but if the discussion on privilege refuses to recognize that concept, I have to say it's designed to pit two groups against each other and create animosity rather than cooperation.

&gt;It's not about revenge - it's about acknowledgement.

May I ask how ""punching up"" and ""Male tears"" are exactly acknowledgement? 

Don't you feel that constant language such as oppressors and privilege are going to make people get upset at these groups and associate them with such terms negatively? Even if it isn't about revenge in it's base concept, it certainly seems to be breeding a lot of hostility and anger through how it chooses to get across it's message. ""These people don't deserve to be treated better than us, they oppress us. they hurt us!"" It certainly creates an attitude among people that could be pretty easy to get lost in don't you agree?

&gt;That's why you'll certainly see discussion of privilege, but the highest levels of frustration with unexamined privilege. Too many members of privileged groups (the same groups that hold social, political, and economic power) either don't see or refuse to acknowledge the way privilege affects their life.

And just a personal gripe, but that's part of my own issue with the movement, they only care for some privileges. How many people who prominently do end up supporting Social Justice end up being from some pretty rich backgrounds (see for example, the man who did the hunger strike recently, who is the son of a multi-millionaire), yet seemingly ignore wealth as a privilege. It seems so common a phrase to say ""those who have privilege can't see it"" but they never seem to take that mean that they should potentially direct the lens back at themselves. I mean, in regards to issues with women, do you ever see female privilege as an idea ever pop up?

I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving.

Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens.

Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility.

I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value!
