19,"Let me preface this by saying that I understand how tough these kids, and their parents have it; I know it can't be easy for them, and I fully appreciate how much it must genuinely suck for them from time to time. That said, *their* condition is not *our* problem. If this had been some drunk asshole making noise, no one would have a problem with people telling him to shut up, or get out. If it was someone talking on a cellphone, I'm sure this actor's facebook post would've had a much different tone. But because the person disrupting the show is a kid with autism we're expected to just say: ""Oh, that's okay, please feel free to disrupt the performance that I paid $60 to see""? Fuck that. Is it unfair to these kids, absolutely it is, but guess what: *Life isn't fair*. *You* don't get to take it upon yourself to decide that everyone else has to accept your kid's behavior. *You* don't get to decide what other people have to be okay with, or how accommodating or understanding they need to be. Being a parent means that sometimes, you're going to miss out on things because of your kids, being the parent of a special needs child that much more, but that doesn't change the fact that it's your responsibility as a parent to know ahead of time what your kids can or cannot handle, and to then plan accordingly. If you take it upon yourself to say: ""Fuck everyone else, I'll take my kid where I want and they'll just have to deal"", then that's your prerogative, but in doing so you forfeit the right to complain/be offended when people tell you to control your kid, or get the fuck out.",1,"Being a parent of an austistic child requires you to give up living all aspects of life., a gain in ""fairness"" for people with special needs is a loss in fairness to those who otherwise get to expect certain behaviors and punish if those standards aren't met (kicking out alcoholics with bad behavior)",1,"The comment frames the situation as a strict binary conflict where accommodating a child with autism necessarily means sacrificing the experience of other audience members, presenting the interaction as a zero-sum scenario where one group's needs can only be met at the direct expense of the other.","{

76,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso ""It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain"" Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially. Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy. Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them. The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them. I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking. ""I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them"" Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche. I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit. I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good. The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior.

94," ""What do you mean?"" Well take this quote from MLK's speech at the March on Washington, the high point of the civil rights movement: ""one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."" Or if that doesn't do it for you think of Desmond Tutus idea of a ""rainbow nation"" if you want a non American civil rights figure as an example. Both of these show that the original civil rights movements advocated multi cultural unity, regardless of colour or race. SJW's as we've seen strive for racial segregation, for cultures to never be mixed for fear of ""appropriation"", for in some cases for there to be  racism against whites as payback for past discrimination against blacks. All rather against MLKs and others visions no? ""If you think it is an ""institutionalized conspiracy"" then you don't really understand what people are talking about. They're not saying there's a secret cabal of white men keeping everyone down."" No they're advocating that the entire system, sometimes the entirety of Western civilisation, is built on institutionalised racism and a load of other isms. ""I'm a white man, and nobody has ever made me feel like I've committed some original sin by being born."" You've never heard of ""check your privilege""? It assigns automatic guilt and fault to someone regardless of actions, rather like the religious concept of original sin. To move away from racial privilege I consider myself an ally of the LGBT movement yet some people would say that simply supporting LGBT rights wouldn't be enough. I'd have to check my straight privilege, understand how I might ""oppress"" others etc. Again rather like original sin. ""People bash fat people just for existing all the time. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to that very notion."" How? Advocating a healthy lifestyle and suggesting that one should aspire not to be unhealthily over weight is simply the truth if that's what you mean by bashing. If you mean r/fatpeoplehate when you say a sub it got banned a long time ago and had what? A few hundred users, many of whom were satirical. ""No, it would not. Segregation and Jim Crow was a whole institution aimed at keeping black people as second class citizens. This doesn't do anything of the sort, it's just a space for a group of people to congregate. Do I necessarily think that racially segregated safe spaces are a good thing? Not really, but not for some bullshit ""we're going back to Jim Crow!"" alarmism."" The entire concept was ""separate but equal"", isn't that what SJW's seek to resurrect with their idea of segregation? ""They're like movie ratings, just a way for people who avoid topics that might cause them distress if it pops up out of nowhere."" And how far should this go? I mean ""I'm offended"" is used to shutdown entire debates.

168,"""but there is never a good reason to cheat."" To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option. Should a person trying to keep their family together without being depressed and miserable all the time, but gets caught, also be penalized without a livable income when they are on their own?

This was an academic report by knowledgable people. The only dissent was the degree to which there as an effect, not IF there was an effect. 3. Your conclusions are flawed and I'll need you to seriously read and listen to the 2+ hours of dialogue and supporting material. Theres no way you could have done that. 4. If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16. Sounds like you don't like the evidence. Not my problem. Did you miss this part? http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/16/shock-flashback-obama-says-illegal-immigration-hurts-blue-collar-americans-strains-welfare-video/ 17. what sort of meandering argument is this? 18. It doesn't create new jobs. It displaces many and those which it creates is supplanted by the false labor market size that doesn't reflect the real influence of illegal immigrant pressure on the resources and society at large 19. You're complaining about a time stamp? 20. You can't point to some shitty HTML website that doesnt even have a wells fargo logo on it and pretend you're trotting out an equitable argument. Fact is, illegals are getting the red carpet.  21. what? 22. This was an academic report by knowledgable people.
