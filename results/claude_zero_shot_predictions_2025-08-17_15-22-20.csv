This was an academic report by knowledgable people. The only dissent was the degree to which there as an effect, not IF there was an effect. 3. Your conclusions are flawed and I'll need you to seriously read and listen to the 2+ hours of dialogue and supporting material. Theres no way you could have done that. 4. If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16. Sounds like you don't like the evidence. Not my problem. Did you miss this part? http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/16/shock-flashback-obama-says-illegal-immigration-hurts-blue-collar-americans-strains-welfare-video/ 17. what sort of meandering argument is this? 18. It doesn't create new jobs. It displaces many and those which it creates is supplanted by the false labor market size that doesn't reflect the real influence of illegal immigrant pressure on the resources and society at large 19. You're complaining about a time stamp? 20. You can't point to some shitty HTML website that doesnt even have a wells fargo logo on it and pretend you're trotting out an equitable argument.

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",1,"The comment repeatedly frames economic interactions as inherently zero-sum, suggesting that gains for one party (e.g., cheaper goods, more free time) must necessarily result in equivalent losses for another party (e.g., wealth transfer, job loss).

The founding document of the United States declares that they are 3/5th of human beings.  Blacks are living proof that a group of people's status can change over time and the issue of citizenship is a highly racial issue.

There are certainly places where life needs a little emotional and non-productivity but this is hardly the place. Chop their funding and stop giving them their own dances and benefits. How about give them a little place at prom or something where social protocol pretty much forces us to give them a 5 minute standing ovation?

If everyone in the world was in a same sex relationship, the human population would be gone in 4 generations. That is a *very* bad thing. I have no issue with LGBT couples. Once you're an adult, do what you want and love who you want. But children exposing children to LGB relationships increases the propensity for them to think they belong in one, when they do not.

20,"""Shame that we have to accomodate for people with disabilities, right?"" First of all, there is a difference between making accommodations for people with disabilities, and allowing someone with a disability to ruin something for everyone else. Second, it's the *businesses* responsibility to make any accommodations, **not the other customers**. If a theater wants to have a show just for special needs guests, that's great. If they want to have a ""kids"" show, I'm all for it. But when you have a show, with 300 - 400 people in a theater, who've paid anywhere from $60 - $250 to see a show, it is ridiculous to tell them: ""You just need to be more understanding"", when they complain about a kid yelling, and screaming, and ""yipping"" in the audience. That said, the whole ""If a person acts out, they can be removed"" argument is just ridiculous, especially when we're talking about one of the most foreseeable problems a parent will ever face. Not to mention that it's still going to disrupt the show that hundreds of people paid to see; one person does not have the right to ruin a show for everyone else, *regardless* of what their situation is.
