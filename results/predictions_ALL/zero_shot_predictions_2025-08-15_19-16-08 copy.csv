76,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso ""It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain"" Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially. Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy. Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them. The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them. I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking. ""I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them"" Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche. I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit. I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good. The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior.

196,"I just really disagree with that final point. Shame is almost never a motivator. While saying everybody is obese for the same reasons is rather reductive, I think its pretty fair to say obesity is almost always a mental illness. Its a very unhealthy relationship with food. An eating disorder. Fixing an obese person is more than just ""well stop eating so much fattie"" its about *why* do they eat so much? Why is the answer to depression, boredom, anger, almost every emotion food? At the end of the day, shaming someone is just going to depress them, and its going to make them turn to what gives them comfort. It's been shown over and over again that shaming smokers just makes them want a cigarette, why would shaming fat people be any different?

121,"""You realize that feminism has never wanted women's superiority (anti-feminists have been claiming this for over 100 years)"" Eh, fuck them anyways because yes they do, they always say all men are rapists. Fuck my friend stopped talking to me because I said feminism is cancer since he said blowing smoke near a woman is RAPE. If a woman thinks thats rape she's stupid and doesn't need to be listened to. Same goes with a man who views it that way. ""there are currently more Mexicans leaving the US than arriving (according to Pew Hispanic)"" I guess it's subjective but I find it weird because Mexico is HORRIBLE. Like damn, i've been and they try to rip you off and all that because they're poor they think they're entitled. ""the average Muslim is the same as the average Christian or Jew-- ordinary, peaceful people trying to live their ordinary, peaceful lives and practise their faith privately.""I know, I have no problem with muslims but in the middle east it's a bit different when their religion dictates the law of a country. Islam isn't a ""peaceful"" religion right now. And don't bring up christianity because yes templars were shitty but there's no international terrorists christians blowing people up and throwing gays off buildings. ""Have you ever looked into police brutality statistics against black people; or rape statistics; or inequalities in hiring practises based on race and gender?"" Of course, i'm educated, I KNOW all this shit. I'm not dumb but yeah im self centered because these fuckers would throw me under the bus because their problems are worse than mine because I have more money than them. Also, I used to be enraged but now I don't care because nobody does shit anyways. Protesting with cardboard signs is laughable but so are riots. If I was a corrupt police officer, a cardboard sign won't stop me, and shooting my brethren would make me more inclined to continue. They don't seem to understand the other side which makes me have less sympathy for them. ""Why is it fun to see her fail at her mission of bringing more equality?"" Because she's stupid and wrong about most things. Her ideas are dangerous and she doesn't want ""equality"" she thinks she does but if she had her way it would just be a matriarchy.  ""What do you think Bernie Sanders would tell you if he heard you talking about how you think mass deportations are a good idea because you want to see people you think are too strident not get their way?"" Never said it was a good idea. I'm pro immigration, they do jobs we hate. They pick most our food, they're willing to also do jobs cheaper. I'm just saying IF trump did that then I wouldn't be upset because yes it'd hurt us but hell, we managed to have Hilary V. Trump...kinda shows what kind of people we are as a nation. ""It belies your self-interest again.""
Of course. I have to be selfish because I don't have anyone but myself, yet people still want to take it away and usually those people are SJW's. EVeryones selfish, I promise you that you're selfish too and a lot of what you vote is out of self interest. Fuck, I voted bernie even though he wasn't my self interest but that's because I wanted us to be more like Europe. Now I don't think we'll get to that point. ""Trump has, by all evidence, defrauded people out of millions of dollars. He wants Russian hackers to attack Hillary Clinton."" Ok, well that's not suprising they both want power. I'm honestly not too mad, it's stupid but i'm not that mad. Sorry. I wouldn't be mad if Hilary did the same to Trump. ""The man is an untrustworthy liar, and yet you want to vote for him because you hate teenagers who stand up for minorities too enthusiastically."" They'd be just as dangerous in power and they stand up for minorities who are black, women and mexican. Nobody else. You can be mentally ill, you can be disabled, you can be a severly depressed white man with no legs, you can be a homeless,  you can be a black conservative most of them won't help you. They'll only help and FEEL offended for you if you're skin color is a certain color AND your beliefs are just like theres. In all honesty, I love people and care about people. But it's hard a lot of times because I've learned I have to be selfish most of the time because nobody else really gives a shit about people. And also I'll most likely end up not voting but it's just like even Trump Supporters I meet are less violent and kinder to me than the others. I went to a trump rally, I was on the side of bernie and nobody said shit to me, they just went saying, ""kill all white people"" and smashing cars and fighting with trump supporters and making kids of trump supporters cry. Then I went to the Trump side and got friendly hellos.  I wasn't dressed nice, i was dressed like a protestor would be but still treated WAY better. It's not because im white or male either.

149,"Men are locked away disproportionally more than women. Women, if they are punished by the law at all, tend to significantly lighter sentences than men do. The same is true for African Americans and other people of color. In addition, men are punished merely for rape *accusations*. They are kicked out of school, shunned by their friends and family, fired from their jobs, and generally disregarded by society.  Even if it is proven that the claim was fake, many parts of society says ""there is probably more to the story, she is just being too nice to drop charges, etc"" and they still suffer. Meanwhile, false rape claims generally do not yield penalty more than a slap on the wrist. Lastly, Men who claim rape against women are ignored and there is no support system for them.",1,"women are unfairly privileged in society to the detriment of men, especially in cases of sexual violence, This author believes that providing support for women inherently leads to losses for men",1,"The comment frames legal and social outcomes as a competition between groups, implying that benefits or leniency for women and people of color come at the direct expense of men, thus presenting the issue as a zero-sum game.","{
