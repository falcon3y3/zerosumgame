50,"""Certainly this sort of language is not conducive to actual understanding.""I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing. Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)). Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it. ""Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face."" I can point you to some subs here on reddit, if you want, where a majority of the users don't believe this.

Bullshit. There is nothing we can do to change the actual past, but there is plenty we can do going forward.

28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

168,"""but there is never a good reason to cheat."" To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option.
