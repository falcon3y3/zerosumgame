82,"I think if you are at the point where you are giving gifts primarily to avoid the awkwardness of giving nothing, it's time to have a conversation about not wanting to do the gift thing any more. I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving. Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens. Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility. I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value! There's also problems with it, and it's not for every relationship, but this is a fundamental argument for gift giving.",1,"Asking for money as a gift devalues the gift giver and renders it a practical exchange , Asking for money instead of gifts will upset the gift-giver and reduce the overall value of the gift",1.0,"The comment frames asking for money as a gift as inherently reducing the value and enjoyment of gift giving, suggesting that gains in practicality or utility come at the cost of alienating the giver and diminishing the social value of the activity.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The comment frames asking for money as a gift as inherently reducing the value and enjoyment of gift giving, suggesting that gains in practicality or utility come at the cost of alienating the giver and diminishing the social value of the activity.""}",2025-08-16_13-47-11

Obama said, speaking of businesses, if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made it happen. Was he advocating government takeover of businesses in this context? No, but this is the logical thought process of why Venezuela and other socialist countries justify the takeover of means of production.

28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school. ""Formal guidelines on reporting suicide have since been adopted for journalists in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, and Hong Kong."" That's funny, because celebrity suicides are always front page in the US. Who adopted these formal guidelines? What was the mechanism of adoption? Who follows them?",1,"two examples: 1) news cannot self-regulate due to self-interests and 2) better mental health systems will not help people who don't seek it out, if people don't want to do something, it's not worth trying to do it (so if people won't go get mental health care, making more care available won't help, and if they want to keep paying for news, you can't get rid of the money, etc) so for each of this poster's points, the gain is canceled by the loss",,"```json

You act like singing songs and dancing is going to somehow stop the conflict. This isn't some clash of cultures that just happened to escalate. This is a century long, systematic oppression and eventual extermination of Palestinians by Israel. Israel has done their best to use PR to convince people otherwise but anyone with basic knowledge of the conflict knows what's going on. And what's the bias here? That people defend Palestine because Israel has been terrorizing them for decades? Over 60 protesters have been killed recently and even a Canadian doctor was shot in the leg by the IDF. As usual the US is continuing to block any investigation attempts at the UN and defends Israel's actions. Is hits the perspective you're defending?
