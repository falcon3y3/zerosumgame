But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

Some of these sites have very small warnings saying the news aren't actually true but 'satire', for legal purposes.. but they are out of the way and the least observant readers aren't going to notice them. I don't see how punishing (and punishment isn't always jail, as in your parents example - there are fines too) people for outright lies damages free speech. 
In fact I would argue for the opposite - the easier it to get away with lying, the less free speech is worth, since people who are telling the truth (or at least being honest and saying what they *believe* is the truth) are less likely to be trusted. After all, if people can lie and not be punished for it, why shouldn't they do that every time it's convenient? Just because there is a grey area such as cases where we suspect the news-spreader knew the news was false, but we can't prove it, doesn't mean *every* case is going to fit in it.",1,"discusses idea that punishing people for mis/disinformation harms free speech, Suggests that protecting harmful satire/free speech comes at the cost of harming and deceiving society",1.0,"The comment frames the issue as a competition between liars and truth-tellers, arguing that allowing lies (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of free speech for honest people (loss), thus presenting a zero-sum dynamic.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The comment frames the issue as a competition between liars and truth-tellers, arguing that allowing lies (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of free speech for honest people (loss), thus presenting a zero-sum dynamic.""}",2025-08-16_13-00-23

If we don't continue our species because we find it more beneficial to us to live our lives comfortably or find a way to live immortally, then how are we hurting future generations if they don't exist?

2,How about the fear that your own cultures values are diminished in the society of your country?

1,"Thank you. That was a thoughtful response. Learning to live together has caused decades, if not centuries, of unrest in the US (where I'm from). Playing the waiting game doesn't seem like a great reason to let more people who are different in. Besides, what about the economic burdens on the average tax payer? They're working hard, putting money into the economy for their and their children's future, such as education and social services.
