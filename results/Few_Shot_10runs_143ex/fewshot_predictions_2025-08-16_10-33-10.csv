Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation.

You're right - it seems pretty crazy to me. Feminists claiming that the statement ""gender equality is for everyone"" is misogynist rhetoric. And the position that men's issues have been drowned out by the focus on women's rights? Well, only a misogynist could think that - just look around you. It's not like we ever see that happening anywhere.",1,"If you think feminism has negatively impacted men's rights and issues, you are a misogynist, Suggests that thinking that men's issues have been drowned out by the focus on women's rights makes someone a misogynist",1.0,"The commenter frames the focus on women's rights as coming at the expense of men's issues, suggesting that gains for one group (women) necessarily result in losses or neglect for the other (men).","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames the focus on women's rights as coming at the expense of men's issues, suggesting that gains for one group (women) necessarily result in losses or neglect for the other (men).""}",2025-08-16_10-33-10
94," ""What do you mean?"" Well take this quote from MLK's speech at the March on Washington, the high point of the civil rights movement: ""one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."" Or if that doesn't do it for you think of Desmond Tutus idea of a ""rainbow nation"" if you want a non American civil rights figure as an example. Both of these show that the original civil rights movements advocated multi cultural unity, regardless of colour or race. SJW's as we've seen strive for racial segregation, for cultures to never be mixed for fear of ""appropriation"", for in some cases for there to be  racism against whites as payback for past discrimination against blacks. All rather against MLKs and others visions no? ""If you think it is an ""institutionalized conspiracy"" then you don't really understand what people are talking about. They're not saying there's a secret cabal of white men keeping everyone down."" No they're advocating that the entire system, sometimes the entirety of Western civilisation, is built on institutionalised racism and a load of other isms. ""I'm a white man, and nobody has ever made me feel like I've committed some original sin by being born."" You've never heard of ""check your privilege""? It assigns automatic guilt and fault to someone regardless of actions, rather like the religious concept of original sin. To move away from racial privilege I consider myself an ally of the LGBT movement yet some people would say that simply supporting LGBT rights wouldn't be enough. I'd have to check my straight privilege, understand how I might ""oppress"" others etc. Again rather like original sin. ""People bash fat people just for existing all the time. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to that very notion."" How? Advocating a healthy lifestyle and suggesting that one should aspire not to be unhealthily over weight is simply the truth if that's what you mean by bashing. If you mean r/fatpeoplehate when you say a sub it got banned a long time ago and had what? A few hundred users, many of whom were satirical. ""No, it would not. Segregation and Jim Crow was a whole institution aimed at keeping black people as second class citizens. This doesn't do anything of the sort, it's just a space for a group of people to congregate. Do I necessarily think that racially segregated safe spaces are a good thing? Not really, but not for some bullshit ""we're going back to Jim Crow!"" alarmism."" The entire concept was ""separate but equal"", isn't that what SJW's seek to resurrect with their idea of segregation? ""They're like movie ratings, just a way for people who avoid topics that might cause them distress if it pops up out of nowhere."" And how far should this go? I mean ""I'm offended"" is used to shutdown entire debates. Maybe no one cares if it upsets you and unless you have very real PTSD there's no excuse as an adult to try and shut someone else up based on your convictions. ""Could you tell me what some of these ""actual facts"" are that people are trying to avoid in safe spaces?"" Basic biology? No you don't have ""headmates"" who share your body, you need to seek medical help. No, biological sex isn't a social construct. Common sense? No, otherkin can't really have the soul of a dragon or wolf. ""There's this idea out there that every single area needs to be widely open to all discussions all the time. 
We're talking about campuses here, not even dorms or private rooms or whatever. Areas meant for discussion.

&gt;But that's just not the case. Do you get upset at funerals when you can't spend the whole time bashing the deceased? Do you think that weddings are an affront to free speech just because the group won't tolerate you giving the bride and groom shit?

Strawman. I'm not arguing for the right to say what you want where ever. I'm talking about not using offense or safe spaces to shutdown legitimate debates.

&gt;As a straight white cis man, I can just fuckin' go to a school cafeteria and nobody will give me shit for who I am or claim that my gender isn't real or talk about how I and people like me are more prone to violence.

149,"Men are locked away disproportionally more than women. Women, if they are punished by the law at all, tend to significantly lighter sentences than men do. The same is true for African Americans and other people of color. In addition, men are punished merely for rape *accusations*. They are kicked out of school, shunned by their friends and family, fired from their jobs, and generally disregarded by society.  Even if it is proven that the claim was fake, many parts of society says ""there is probably more to the story, she is just being too nice to drop charges, etc"" and they still suffer. Meanwhile, false rape claims generally do not yield penalty more than a slap on the wrist.
