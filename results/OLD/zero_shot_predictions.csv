Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",1,"The comment frames international trade as a scenario where one nation's gain (wealth accumulation by island nation A) directly results in another nation's loss (wealth leaving island nation B), exemplifying a zero-sum perspective on economic exchange.","{

If I was a corrupt police officer, a cardboard sign won't stop me, and shooting my brethren would make me more inclined to continue. They don't seem to understand the other side which makes me have less sympathy for them. ""Why is it fun to see her fail at her mission of bringing more equality?"" Because she's stupid and wrong about most things. Her ideas are dangerous and she doesn't want ""equality"" she thinks she does but if she had her way it would just be a matriarchy.  ""What do you think Bernie Sanders would tell you if he heard you talking about how you think mass deportations are a good idea because you want to see people you think are too strident not get their way?"" Never said it was a good idea. I'm pro immigration, they do jobs we hate. They pick most our food, they're willing to also do jobs cheaper. I'm just saying IF trump did that then I wouldn't be upset because yes it'd hurt us but hell, we managed to have Hilary V. Trump...kinda shows what kind of people we are as a nation. ""It belies your self-interest again.""
Of course. I have to be selfish because I don't have anyone but myself, yet people still want to take it away and usually those people are SJW's. EVeryones selfish, I promise you that you're selfish too and a lot of what you vote is out of self interest. Fuck, I voted bernie even though he wasn't my self interest but that's because I wanted us to be more like Europe. Now I don't think we'll get to that point. ""Trump has, by all evidence, defrauded people out of millions of dollars. He wants Russian hackers to attack Hillary Clinton."" Ok, well that's not suprising they both want power. I'm honestly not too mad, it's stupid but i'm not that mad. Sorry. I wouldn't be mad if Hilary did the same to Trump. ""The man is an untrustworthy liar, and yet you want to vote for him because you hate teenagers who stand up for minorities too enthusiastically."" They'd be just as dangerous in power and they stand up for minorities who are black, women and mexican. Nobody else. You can be mentally ill, you can be disabled, you can be a severly depressed white man with no legs, you can be a homeless,  you can be a black conservative most of them won't help you. They'll only help and FEEL offended for you if you're skin color is a certain color AND your beliefs are just like theres. In all honesty, I love people and care about people. But it's hard a lot of times because I've learned I have to be selfish most of the time because nobody else really gives a shit about people. And also I'll most likely end up not voting but it's just like even Trump Supporters I meet are less violent and kinder to me than the others. I went to a trump rally, I was on the side of bernie and nobody said shit to me, they just went saying, ""kill all white people"" and smashing cars and fighting with trump supporters and making kids of trump supporters cry. Then I went to the Trump side and got friendly hellos.  I wasn't dressed nice, i was dressed like a protestor would be but still treated WAY better. It's not because im white or male either.
