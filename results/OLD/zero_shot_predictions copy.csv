Erdogan is an Islamist. His political party endorse political Islam. That is in no way compatible with our legal system.

77,"""For example even though each politician as an individual might be a good person and willing to work for the common good, when they are inside a bipartisan elective system in which corruption is legal, their good intentions do not matter that much. You could replace all the individuals within the political system and it wouldn't really change the situation on the long term (same causes, same effects)."" Would you say it's okay to say that an individual good person is considered at fault for being in such a system (especially if it was at a system where they had no choice to be considered a member of)? It seems you are somewhat unfamiliar with the situation going on (or so I assume from how you write) so I can't necessarily give a good or unbiased summary, but I do personally see some stuff like that quite a bit in regards to social justice. That a white person is considered inherently racist for being into a system that is considered racist. While I may agree a huge overhaul of a system may be required, there is quite a bit of blame and animosity put towards the people that form such a system and I don't see that as being much better.",1,"social justice ideas require blaming people for structural issues based on their identity, If a system that is deemed inherently racist is upheld by people that it benefits, those people will be considered racist",1,"The comment frames the issue as one where blame and animosity are directed at individuals for being part of a system, implying that gains for one group (e.g., social justice advocates) come at the expense of another (e.g., individuals in the system), which reflects a zero-sum perspective.","{

55,"I am opposed to animal abuse. Why? Because I don't think someone should go and kick their dog for barking, or throw rocks at a cat because they think it is funny. These animals did nothing wrong, and intentionally causing them harm does nothing beneficial for anyone while harming the animal. In it's most basic sense, I would consider animal abuse the unnecessary harming of an animal. The key word in that statement is unnecessary. I think that factory farming of meat is a necessary part of our global economy and food source. Just think about what would happen if we somehow magically removed all meat from everyone's diet due to ethical concerns. [The average person eats around 92 pounds of meat per year](http://chartsbin.com/view/12730) and, with your number of 99% coming from factories, let's just say 91 pounds of meat is removed from everyone's diet. How would we possibly get the farmland available to produce 600+ billion pounds of soy product? Is the meat production industry perfect? Not at all, but I recognize it as an necessary fact of global food production, and therefore think it is unreasonable to boycott it as abusive. ",1,"For the global economy to thrive and food sources be maintained, factory farming must exist, hurting animals for no reason is abuse, but hurting animals for a purpose (eating) is not abuse, therefore eating animals is not abuse (gain) and any argument suggesting otherwise is wrong (loss) because there would be a use loss (not enough food)",0,"The comment discusses the necessity of factory farming for global food production and argues against boycotting it, but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one side must result in equivalent losses for the other; rather, it focuses on practical considerations and necessity.","{
