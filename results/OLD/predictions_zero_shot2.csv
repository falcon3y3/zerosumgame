33,"""Then there are those who quite simply don't buy into genders at all and want to eliminate the classification entirely for a reason I think you can get behind.

I am calling myself short because I feel I am and everyone else I am friendly with towers over me. _Other_ people keep lumping me in with the worthless and genetically valueless in society.

Yeah, it's pretty fucking pathetic and piss-poor for an adult male living in the first world, let alone the US or northern Europe. The ""average"" man is fucking pathetic and not anything any single person should ever strive to be. That's why most women with self-worth DO NOT want to date mediocre/worthless men. That's why they say stuff like ""six foot minimum"" and have other 'standards' they follow. Those who have absolutely no standards at all will accept ""average""/worthless men as partners. In society, literally the only thing that matters to people among male height is how ""tall"" you are. Being ""not tall/short"" makes you valueless among people, but even the short(er) ones can often benefit from being weak and small in other ways, such as horse jockeys or gymnasts. It's just that we strike out in social settings, especially in dating. So yes, even being short is better than being ""neither tall nor short"", as some people would put it.

It may make you uncomfortable. It may imply bigotry, just as me saying ""bitch"" might imply misogyny. If I stub my toe and shout ""bitch"" it's probably not very indicative of anything.

If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.
