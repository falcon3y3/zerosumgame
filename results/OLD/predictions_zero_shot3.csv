45,"No it doesn't. But how many people are actually really trying to get better at a demanding skill? Not a lot apparently since job boards are looking and taking dam near any body nowadays. Those that can't, get the support they need to get by but if they want a grander life they have to break the box and do things beyond their limitations.

122,"Muslim isn't a race. It's an ideology that's vile hateful and violent. It's like saying we don't want Nazis. What comments on women? You mean individual women? That's not bigotry. And why should a woman have all the choice? I had my first child murdered by a girl who lied about taking the pill. Where was my right to choose? A woman's right to choose by necessity robs men of theirs. Why is it bigoted not to want more people in your country? We have to give away resources and opportunity to foreigners or we are bigots?

Are you now an asshole too because you're gay? That's the extent of the logic you are using here."" That's what you're seeing in my words, but it isn't what I'm saying. For starters, being gay is not a choice. Being Muslim IS a choice. For seconds, I am not judging Muslims based on the actions of one person. I am judging them based on a book they call good and true, AND I am judging them based on surveys showing the opinions of millions of Muslims in countries across the globe.

65,"Is depression ""curable""? What would you consider a"" cure"" for depression? SSRIs? There's plenty of contention as to their efficacy and they can have serious side effects such as the loss of sexual function and sensitivity.

6,"If a person ""just is"" lazy, that still means they are unmotivated and lazy and that is why they are getting the surgery. Which is kind of my point: they get the surgery because they are not motivated. Laziness can change. Every one is lazy.

66,"It's not just fringe radicals that hold unpalatable views. It's feminists everywhere.For instance, just last week, the University of York (England) planned to acknowledge International Men's Day. The statement about it highlighted issues like male-underachivement in university (which is true in all Western countries), male suicide and mental health (men are far more likely to commit suicide than women, etc. You can read the original statement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3t1l7p/university_of_york_cancels_international_mens_day/cx2ah47). In response - a few hundred feminists at the university wrote a bigoted and self-serving letter to the university condemning International Men's Day, and saying that it was bad because it did not address women's issues (which was obviously the point). Which you can [read here](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2015/11/16/open-letter-blasts-universitys-decision-to-mark-international-mens-day-read-it-here/).

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",1,"The comment frames free trade as a scenario where one nation's gain (wealth accumulation by island nation A) directly results in another nation's loss (wealth leaving island nation B), presenting the relationship as inherently adversarial and zero-sum."
68,"So if a feminist group was banned by the university without good reason, if they then claim that they are being silenced, then their claims are false.

Since we can hear the complaints about the government silencing dissent.Your logic is ridiculous.",1,"the idea that people who complain about being marginalized are negating their marginalization by virtue of the complaint is flawed logic, Suggests that being able to claim that groups have not been silenced since you can hear their complaints only serves to further harm the cause of free speech",1,"The comment frames the issue as if the ability of one side to complain negates any loss or silencing, implying that gains in expression for one side must mean no loss for the other, which is a zero-sum perspective."
10,"""Doesn't the fact that you are trying so hard to disbelieve or discredit 13% of female seniors stating they were penetrated without consent (which was clearly defined in the survey and not open to misinterpretation) suggest the existence of rape culture?

That goes way, way beyond healthy or reasonable skepticism."" If there is one who exaggerated, there are two, where there are two there are theee. Why do we continually see false rape culture examples? UVA , Lena Dunham, mattress girl ect.

153,"Because children are *highly* susceptible to the power of suggestion even more so than the average human brain. Most people are biologically and programmed to be attracted to the opposite sex.

It definitely was not made up on the spot, though. After a lifetime of feeling not quite right being a girl, it all clicked for me when I learned about non-binary identities, and I was able to feel at peace with myself for the first time. I think you might need to examine exactly why you feel so strongly about people (who in no way actually affect you) that you want them to die. Also, if you think we're all mentally ill (admittedly, many of us do struggle with mental illness, which is why suicide rates are high, even when we are generally accepted) you should want for us to seek help and get better, not die.
