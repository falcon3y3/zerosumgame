135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.

123,You honestly are attempting to argue that Islam is compatible with western culture? Sharia councils are used in Muslim countries and in the UK as a sort of tribunal to settle disputes within Islam. We have a very different legal system founded from secular roots. Under no circumstances should an Islamic council of any sort be allowed to issue an judgement in a western country and there is not s single reason any Muslim apologist can give to the contrary. Turkey has traditionally been a fault line between the west and the Islamic world. Attaturk was a secularist and you are referencing a Turkey that is been purged away in front of us as we speak. Erdogan is an Islamist. His political party endorse political Islam. That is in no way compatible with our legal system. Would you want an Islamist political party standing for election in a Western European nation or the US? If you say yes then in my eyes you are trying to destroy the very country you live in.

94," ""What do you mean?"" Well take this quote from MLK's speech at the March on Washington, the high point of the civil rights movement: ""one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."" Or if that doesn't do it for you think of Desmond Tutus idea of a ""rainbow nation"" if you want a non American civil rights figure as an example. Both of these show that the original civil rights movements advocated multi cultural unity, regardless of colour or race. SJW's as we've seen strive for racial segregation, for cultures to never be mixed for fear of ""appropriation"", for in some cases for there to be  racism against whites as payback for past discrimination against blacks. All rather against MLKs and others visions no? ""If you think it is an ""institutionalized conspiracy"" then you don't really understand what people are talking about. They're not saying there's a secret cabal of white men keeping everyone down."" No they're advocating that the entire system, sometimes the entirety of Western civilisation, is built on institutionalised racism and a load of other isms. ""I'm a white man, and nobody has ever made me feel like I've committed some original sin by being born."" You've never heard of ""check your privilege""? It assigns automatic guilt and fault to someone regardless of actions, rather like the religious concept of original sin. To move away from racial privilege I consider myself an ally of the LGBT movement yet some people would say that simply supporting LGBT rights wouldn't be enough. I'd have to check my straight privilege, understand how I might ""oppress"" others etc. Again rather like original sin. ""People bash fat people just for existing all the time. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to that very notion."" How? Advocating a healthy lifestyle and suggesting that one should aspire not to be unhealthily over weight is simply the truth if that's what you mean by bashing. If you mean r/fatpeoplehate when you say a sub it got banned a long time ago and had what? A few hundred users, many of whom were satirical. ""No, it would not. Segregation and Jim Crow was a whole institution aimed at keeping black people as second class citizens. This doesn't do anything of the sort, it's just a space for a group of people to congregate.

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",,"```json

70,"""Are people only allowed to be outraged over only one thing?"" You just sealed OP's point, they aren't outraged by black on black crime. They aren't drawing any attention to it and that's the point, that's why it is misguided. Police shootings is a much smaller problem than black on black crime and there is absolutely no focus of any sort on it. If they really cared about the deaths of blacks, they would focus on the largest problem in addition to police shootings. But they don't, they never discuss it, and if people even bring it up an argument starts about it rather than admitting it is even an issue. Edit: people down voting me are only supporting and sharing the negative stereotypes of BLM. People don't care about social discourse anymore. They want to be heard and don't want to listen.

133,"I am one of the shortest among my peers and _**I** definitely_ consider myself pretty fucking short considering just how extremely common it is to find females on campus that are 178 cm and 184 cm (5'10""-6'0"") tall. To OTHER PEOPLE, I am considered that valueless/worthless level, and what _they_ are saying contradicts my own personal experiences. I am calling myself short because I feel I am and everyone else I am friendly with towers over me. _Other_ people keep lumping me in with the worthless and genetically valueless in society. And I fucking hate being as little as I am, but I fucking hate being called ""worthless"" even more. Yeah, it's pretty fucking pathetic and piss-poor for an adult male living in the first world, let alone the US or northern Europe. The ""average"" man is fucking pathetic and not anything any single person should ever strive to be. That's why most women with self-worth DO NOT want to date mediocre/worthless men. That's why they say stuff like ""six foot minimum"" and have other 'standards' they follow. Those who have absolutely no standards at all will accept ""average""/worthless men as partners. In society, literally the only thing that matters to people among male height is how ""tall"" you are. Being ""not tall/short"" makes you valueless among people, but even the short(er) ones can often benefit from being weak and small in other ways, such as horse jockeys or gymnasts. It's just that we strike out in social settings, especially in dating. So yes, even being short is better than being ""neither tall nor short"", as some people would put it. There are no advantages to having no advantages (as you might call it, ""average""). Plenty of downsides though, usually more of those associated with the short end.",1,"being considered average is worse than being lower or higher status, The author believes that being a short male means that you will automatically lose out on all of the social benefits that tall men have",,"```json
