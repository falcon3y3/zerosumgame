28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture.

186,"There are many reasons why sitting to pee is better than standing. I'm a guy. I like to sit to pee, at least at home. It's more comfortable to sit, and I don't risk peeing on the floor or seat. Since I live alone, I'm the one who has to clean up the mess if I do. I usually use a urinal in public, but I can see why someone would choose not to. Urinals have the risk of splash back, and toilet seats aren't that dirty. If the idea of germs bugs you, you can always sit on a layer of toilet paper or squat over the seat. One of the reasons Americans are so out of shape is because they don't squat on a daily basis when going to the bathroom anymore.

168,"""but there is never a good reason to cheat."" To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option. Should a person trying to keep their family together without being depressed and miserable all the time, but gets caught, also be penalized without a livable income when they are on their own?
