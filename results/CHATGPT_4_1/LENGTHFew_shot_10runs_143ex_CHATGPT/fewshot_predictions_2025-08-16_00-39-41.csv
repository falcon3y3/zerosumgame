107,"""Aka: I have no argument, I just wanna hate on those Evil Feminist"" I've presented detailed arguments and there is nothing wrong with hating evil people. Don't want me to hate you? Convince me that you and your group aren't as evil as my experience of you suggests. Don't act as if I'm being absurd for judging you when the evidence I have says your ideology is fucking awful. ""Personally I don't view a single opinion article and one organization (which does have programs for men fyi) as enough support to say ""all of western society accepts this"".""I didn't say all of western society accepts it. I said it was a position held by feminist groups. What is the critical number of articles you need to be convinced that it is actually a thing that feminists advocate for? ""Regardless, every feminist I know, myself included, is against the prison complex that does hurt men..."" Yes, sure you are. Every men's issue is totally a concern for feminists when their failure to address them is rubbed in their faces by anti-feminists. The moment you aren't arguing with us, suddenly it doesn't seem to be quite so pressing. But feel free to link me to all the feminists campaigning for equal prison time. I'm sure it's a far more significant issue for you than manspreading or sexy video game characters so there will be plenty of campaigns about it. I like the way you are 'against the prison complex' rather than the discrimination. So we should be sending fewer people to prison in general? Of course, when an issue mostly affects women, feminists make sure that all the support is given to women. When it mostly affect men, then it's time to treat *everyone* better. ""...why is it a zero sum game?"" Because people like you declared war on people like me and turned everything into a battle. ""Why can't everyone go to jail less?""
Because some of them are fucking dangerous criminals, maybe? ""I wonder why? MRAs paint this huge anti-feminist picture and then expect feminist to just join in.

You try and shut down any discussion you can't control. You spread lies about groups fighting for equality. You pull fire alarms, call in bomb threats, protest anyone who dares to question you. Your forums are full of nonsense and hatred. How exactly do you expect to be treated?

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",1.0,"The comment frames free trade as a scenario where one nation's gain (cheaper goods and more free time) necessarily results in another nation's loss (loss of wealth, inflation, and loss of domestic jobs), presenting the situation as a strict gain/loss framework.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The comment frames free trade as a scenario where one nation's gain (cheaper goods and more free time) necessarily results in another nation's loss (loss of wealth, inflation, and loss of domestic jobs), presenting the situation as a strict gain/loss framework.""}",2025-08-16_00-39-41
