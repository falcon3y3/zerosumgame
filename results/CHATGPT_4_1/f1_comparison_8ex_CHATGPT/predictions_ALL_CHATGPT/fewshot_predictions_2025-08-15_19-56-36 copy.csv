Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade.

28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school. ""Formal guidelines on reporting suicide have since been adopted for journalists in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, and Hong Kong."" That's funny, because celebrity suicides are always front page in the US. Who adopted these formal guidelines? What was the mechanism of adoption? Who follows them?",1,"two examples: 1) news cannot self-regulate due to self-interests and 2) better mental health systems will not help people who don't seek it out, if people don't want to do something, it's not worth trying to do it (so if people won't go get mental health care, making more care available won't help, and if they want to keep paying for news, you can't get rid of the money, etc) so for each of this poster's points, the gain is canceled by the loss",0,"The comment critiques the practicality and effectiveness of various policy responses to mass shootings, but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one side must result in losses for another; it focuses on feasibility and incentives rather than a strict gain/loss tradeoff between groups.","{""zero_sum"": 0, ""justification"": ""The comment critiques the practicality and effectiveness of various policy responses to mass shootings, but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one side must result in losses for another; it focuses on feasibility and incentives rather than a strict gain/loss tradeoff between groups.""}",2025-08-15_19-56-36
78,"""That is done in two ways: by highlighting the ways in which identity generates unfavorable treatment for unprivileged groups, and by highlighting the way identity generates favorable treatment for privileged groups."" And where exactly is the middle ground, the default? Privileged people are treated unfairly beneficially, and unprivileged people are disadvantaged. Where is the group that is neither unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged? What is the base level of human treatment that is not unfair? That's a big part of my issue is that there really is no room for a base treatment, if someone is treated somewhat better, everyone else is now unprivileged in comparison. There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups? That there are people who are chosen because of their identity, privileged, people not chosen because of their identity, unprivileged, and those who are chosen/not chosen not due to identity, default or neutral. By conflating groups the first and last groups you just seem to making bigger issues and suggests that the solution is something entirely different. Sorry, but if the discussion on privilege refuses to recognize that concept, I have to say it's designed to pit two groups against each other and create animosity rather than cooperation. ""It's not about revenge - it's about acknowledgement."" May I ask how ""punching up"" and ""Male tears"" are exactly acknowledgement? Don't you feel that constant language such as oppressors and privilege are going to make people get upset at these groups and associate them with such terms negatively? Even if it isn't about revenge in it's base concept, it certainly seems to be breeding a lot of hostility and anger through how it chooses to get across it's message. ""These people don't deserve to be treated better than us, they oppress us. they hurt us!"" It certainly creates an attitude among people that could be pretty easy to get lost in don't you agree? ""That's why you'll certainly see discussion of privilege, but the highest levels of frustration with unexamined privilege. Too many members of privileged groups (the same groups that hold social, political, and economic power) either don't see or refuse to acknowledge the way privilege affects their life."" And just a personal gripe, but that's part of my own issue with the movement, they only care for some privileges. How many people who prominently do end up supporting Social Justice end up being from some pretty rich backgrounds (see for example, the man who did the hunger strike recently, who is the son of a multi-millionaire), yet seemingly ignore wealth as a privilege. It seems so common a phrase to say ""those who have privilege can't see it"" but they never seem to take that mean that they should potentially direct the lens back at themselves. I mean, in regards to issues with women, do you ever see female privilege as an idea ever pop up? There is basically no consideration that there might be some while you can have some of the most benign and untrue stuff be considered male privilege.",1,"Using language like ""oppressed"" and ""privilege"" inherently divides people, When one group has benefits another group will by nature be disadvantaged",1,"The commenter frames privilege as a dichotomy where any advantage for one group necessarily creates disadvantage for others, arguing that discussions of privilege inherently pit groups against each other and foster animosity, which is characteristic of zero-sum thinking.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames privilege as a dichotomy where any advantage for one group necessarily creates disadvantage for others, arguing that discussions of privilege inherently pit groups against each other and foster animosity, which is characteristic of zero-sum thinking.""}",2025-08-15_19-56-36
