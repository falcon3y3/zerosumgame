82,"I think if you are at the point where you are giving gifts primarily to avoid the awkwardness of giving nothing, it's time to have a conversation about not wanting to do the gift thing any more. I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving. Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens. Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility. I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value! There's also problems with it, and it's not for every relationship, but this is a fundamental argument for gift giving.",1,"Asking for money as a gift devalues the gift giver and renders it a practical exchange , Asking for money instead of gifts will upset the gift-giver and reduce the overall value of the gift",0,The comment discusses the social dynamics and utility of different forms of gift giving without framing the issue as one party's gain being another's loss; it focuses on the value and enjoyment of the activity rather than a strict gain/loss tradeoff.,"{""zero_sum"": 0, ""justification"": ""The comment discusses the social dynamics and utility of different forms of gift giving without framing the issue as one party's gain being another's loss; it focuses on the value and enjoyment of the activity rather than a strict gain/loss tradeoff.""}",2025-08-15_19-30-55

135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade.

144,"Socialism is inherently evil because it says I do not own what I create. Someone with a gun comes along and says, You didn't make that, I made that. And then they take my stuff, and in the spirit of altruism, give it to someone who didn't. Or, as often is the case, keep it for themselves. I can think of a president in recent memory who said something similar along those lines. Oh, I remember what it was. Obama said, speaking of businesses, if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made it happen. Was he advocating government takeover of businesses in this context? No, but this is the logical thought process of why Venezuela and other socialist countries justify the takeover of means of production. ""Well, if government didn't supply roads and infrastructure then businesses would be able to exist."" Faulty logic. The government can't own anything because the government can't produce the wealth to build anything. All wealth is created by the labor of the individual. The only thing the government can do is come along with more guns than the individual and take away the product of their labor.

72,"""It's really not difficult to understand. I'm also sure most of the people saying ""educate yourself"" would agree that it doesn't take very long to look up.

If you spent that little bit of time to look it up, you would know perfectly well why there is backlash.

196,"I just really disagree with that final point. Shame is almost never a motivator. While saying everybody is obese for the same reasons is rather reductive, I think its pretty fair to say obesity is almost always a mental illness. Its a very unhealthy relationship with food. An eating disorder. Fixing an obese person is more than just ""well stop eating so much fattie"" its about *why* do they eat so much? Why is the answer to depression, boredom, anger, almost every emotion food? At the end of the day, shaming someone is just going to depress them, and its going to make them turn to what gives them comfort. It's been shown over and over again that shaming smokers just makes them want a cigarette, why would shaming fat people be any different?
