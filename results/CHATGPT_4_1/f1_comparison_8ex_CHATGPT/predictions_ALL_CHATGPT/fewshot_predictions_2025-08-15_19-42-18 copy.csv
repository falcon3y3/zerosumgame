",1,"People who identify outside of the gender binary do so with intent to denigrate others, the people who want to identify as extra genders (society based) are conflating their identities with sexual orientation (supposedly biology based), and when they do that (gain for them) they tend to create scenarios where they ask for more empathy from constructed attacks (loss)",1,"The commenter frames 'multi gender' individuals as manipulative and as gaining empathy or attention at the direct expense of others' emotional well-being, suggesting that their gain (empathy, attention) is a loss for others (being taken advantage of), which is a zero-sum framing.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames 'multi gender' individuals as manipulative and as gaining empathy or attention at the direct expense of others' emotional well-being, suggesting that their gain (empathy, attention) is a loss for others (being taken advantage of), which is a zero-sum framing.""}",2025-08-15_19-42-18
120,"I did not say say that satire or any nonliteral statement should be banned. Rather, it should be always obvious from context that it's not true. 
You shouldn't be able to deceive people and then claim you didn't really mean that and they should have realized it was false. Are you familiar with fake news/hoax sites? They're basically an evil version of the Onion. They're far from harmless - often the hoaxes promote racism and other forms of prejudice, so they can actually do serious damage and endanger people. Some of these sites have very small warnings saying the news aren't actually true but 'satire', for legal purposes.. but they are out of the way and the least observant readers aren't going to notice them. I don't see how punishing (and punishment isn't always jail, as in your parents example - there are fines too) people for outright lies damages free speech. 
In fact I would argue for the opposite - the easier it to get away with lying, the less free speech is worth, since people who are telling the truth (or at least being honest and saying what they *believe* is the truth) are less likely to be trusted. After all, if people can lie and not be punished for it, why shouldn't they do that every time it's convenient? Just because there is a grey area such as cases where we suspect the news-spreader knew the news was false, but we can't prove it, doesn't mean *every* case is going to fit in it.",1,"discusses idea that punishing people for mis/disinformation harms free speech, Suggests that protecting harmful satire/free speech comes at the cost of harming and deceiving society",1,"The comment frames the issue as a zero-sum game by arguing that allowing lies (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of free speech for honest people (loss for truth-tellers), suggesting that one group's gain necessarily results in another's loss.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The comment frames the issue as a zero-sum game by arguing that allowing lies (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of free speech for honest people (loss for truth-tellers), suggesting that one group's gain necessarily results in another's loss.""}",2025-08-15_19-42-18
