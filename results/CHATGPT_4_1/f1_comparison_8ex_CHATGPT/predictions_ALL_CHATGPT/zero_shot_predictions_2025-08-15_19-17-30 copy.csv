168,"""but there is never a good reason to cheat."" To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option.

94," ""What do you mean?"" Well take this quote from MLK's speech at the March on Washington, the high point of the civil rights movement: ""one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."" Or if that doesn't do it for you think of Desmond Tutus idea of a ""rainbow nation"" if you want a non American civil rights figure as an example. Both of these show that the original civil rights movements advocated multi cultural unity, regardless of colour or race. SJW's as we've seen strive for racial segregation, for cultures to never be mixed for fear of ""appropriation"", for in some cases for there to be  racism against whites as payback for past discrimination against blacks. All rather against MLKs and others visions no? ""If you think it is an ""institutionalized conspiracy"" then you don't really understand what people are talking about. They're not saying there's a secret cabal of white men keeping everyone down."" No they're advocating that the entire system, sometimes the entirety of Western civilisation, is built on institutionalised racism and a load of other isms. ""I'm a white man, and nobody has ever made me feel like I've committed some original sin by being born."" You've never heard of ""check your privilege""? It assigns automatic guilt and fault to someone regardless of actions, rather like the religious concept of original sin. To move away from racial privilege I consider myself an ally of the LGBT movement yet some people would say that simply supporting LGBT rights wouldn't be enough. I'd have to check my straight privilege, understand how I might ""oppress"" others etc. Again rather like original sin. ""People bash fat people just for existing all the time. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to that very notion."" How? Advocating a healthy lifestyle and suggesting that one should aspire not to be unhealthily over weight is simply the truth if that's what you mean by bashing. If you mean r/fatpeoplehate when you say a sub it got banned a long time ago and had what? A few hundred users, many of whom were satirical. ""No, it would not. Segregation and Jim Crow was a whole institution aimed at keeping black people as second class citizens. This doesn't do anything of the sort, it's just a space for a group of people to congregate. Do I necessarily think that racially segregated safe spaces are a good thing? Not really, but not for some bullshit ""we're going back to Jim Crow!"" alarmism."" The entire concept was ""separate but equal"", isn't that what SJW's seek to resurrect with their idea of segregation? ""They're like movie ratings, just a way for people who avoid topics that might cause them distress if it pops up out of nowhere."" And how far should this go? I mean ""I'm offended"" is used to shutdown entire debates. Maybe no one cares if it upsets you and unless you have very real PTSD there's no excuse as an adult to try and shut someone else up based on your convictions. ""Could you tell me what some of these ""actual facts"" are that people are trying to avoid in safe spaces?"" Basic biology? No you don't have ""headmates"" who share your body, you need to seek medical help. No, biological sex isn't a social construct. Common sense? No, otherkin can't really have the soul of a dragon or wolf. ""There's this idea out there that every single area needs to be widely open to all discussions all the time.

Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10.

Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end.

How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16.

I also knew I was human long before I understood what that really means. It must be nonsense. I'm a chimp now, because I wanna jerk off in public and throw my shit around.

69,"""To a certain extent, our actions are an extension of our personality and the views we hold, so if your gay friend says ""I don't like it when you say that"" and you continue to do so, it would indicate to me that you respect your gay friend (and possibly other gay people too) less than they deserve since I have no doubt you would cease saying ""nigger"" if a black friend told you they had a problem with it."" To a certain extent, indeed. This is the crux of the /r/SRS vs Reddit at Large movement. To what extent do we owe other people the right to not be offended at the expense of our own expression. I might counter to a close friend offended by something I said that, ""I don't like it when you put your personal negative connotations associated with language on my expression."" Obviously there's some kind of line to be drawn. It's unreasonable for me to shout ""nigger"" in Times Square and be self-righteous about people being offended. But what if I say a white lady practicing yoga is culturally appropriating from Asian culture? Being that ""gay"" as an insult so ubiquitous among self-identified not-homophobes, I think it's unreasonable for someone to assume that calling something ""gay"" is necessarily bigoted. It may make you uncomfortable. It may imply bigotry, just as me saying ""bitch"" might imply misogyny. If I stub my toe and shout ""bitch"" it's probably not very indicative of anything. If I call a woman I'm on a date with a bitch for not giving me a blow job under the table, I might not be a feminist.

135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.  More people will need to just do art as a hobby.  You simply can't be as good if you aren't working and practicing as much.
