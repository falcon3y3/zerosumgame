If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16.

69,"""To a certain extent, our actions are an extension of our personality and the views we hold, so if your gay friend says ""I don't like it when you say that"" and you continue to do so, it would indicate to me that you respect your gay friend (and possibly other gay people too) less than they deserve since I have no doubt you would cease saying ""nigger"" if a black friend told you they had a problem with it."" To a certain extent, indeed. This is the crux of the /r/SRS vs Reddit at Large movement. To what extent do we owe other people the right to not be offended at the expense of our own expression. I might counter to a close friend offended by something I said that, ""I don't like it when you put your personal negative connotations associated with language on my expression."" Obviously there's some kind of line to be drawn. It's unreasonable for me to shout ""nigger"" in Times Square and be self-righteous about people being offended. But what if I say a white lady practicing yoga is culturally appropriating from Asian culture? Being that ""gay"" as an insult so ubiquitous among self-identified not-homophobes, I think it's unreasonable for someone to assume that calling something ""gay"" is necessarily bigoted. It may make you uncomfortable. It may imply bigotry, just as me saying ""bitch"" might imply misogyny. If I stub my toe and shout ""bitch"" it's probably not very indicative of anything. If I call a woman I'm on a date with a bitch for not giving me a blow job under the table, I might not be a feminist.

And what I am saying is that nobody should have the right to make that decision.  But we are talking about who is more aggressive here and since I don't see the other side making similar statements, I have to say that even if you were 100% right and I agreed with your statement completely, it would still be the more aggressive position of the two.
