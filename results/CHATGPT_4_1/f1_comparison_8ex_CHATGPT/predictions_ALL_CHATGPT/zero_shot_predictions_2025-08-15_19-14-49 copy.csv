This was an academic report by knowledgable people. The only dissent was the degree to which there as an effect, not IF there was an effect. 3. Your conclusions are flawed and I'll need you to seriously read and listen to the 2+ hours of dialogue and supporting material. Theres no way you could have done that. 4. If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16. Sounds like you don't like the evidence. Not my problem. Did you miss this part? http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/16/shock-flashback-obama-says-illegal-immigration-hurts-blue-collar-americans-strains-welfare-video/ 17. what sort of meandering argument is this? 18.

Sometimes prenups work (if they are not contested or the ex cannot afford a good attorney), but often they are not worth the paper they were written on. People, like you, erroneously believe they offer more protection than they do. There are countless cases where prenups were thrown out and judges give wives a fortune in alimony.

11,"""Most accusations are true, most people just never come forward, when you read victimization surveys way more people come forward about being raped than people reporting it.""The only sources I've seen that bafk your claim up are those third party surveys that use non-legal, nebulous definitions of rape such as ""have you had sex while drunk"" and while I don't feel like a rape victim, that question proves I'm dating a rapist. Same goes for that survey claiming half of men are rapists if you don't call them rapists, asking ""have you ever used drugs or alcohol to get sex"" meaning any guy who bought a girl a drink at a bar is an attempted rapist. So again.  What's your source? ""It is still innocent until proven guilty under the law, but we aren't discussing law we are discussing culture"" You've said this on Reddit.
