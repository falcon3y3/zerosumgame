144,"Socialism is inherently evil because it says I do not own what I create. Someone with a gun comes along and says, You didn't make that, I made that. And then they take my stuff, and in the spirit of altruism, give it to someone who didn't. Or, as often is the case, keep it for themselves. I can think of a president in recent memory who said something similar along those lines. Oh, I remember what it was. Obama said, speaking of businesses, if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made it happen. Was he advocating government takeover of businesses in this context? No, but this is the logical thought process of why Venezuela and other socialist countries justify the takeover of means of production. ""Well, if government didn't supply roads and infrastructure then businesses would be able to exist."" Faulty logic.

50,"""Certainly this sort of language is not conducive to actual understanding.""I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing. Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)). Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it. ""Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face."" I can point you to some subs here on reddit, if you want, where a majority of the users don't believe this.

&gt;there's nothing you or I can do about it. 

Bullshit. There is nothing we can do to change the actual past, but there is plenty we can do going forward.

&gt;The author is being condescending

Let's pretend that this is actually about language and/or method of the message. Why is being condescending off the table?

You understand how debilitating marginalization is, right? It seems to me this call for politeness is still the dominate group setting the rules of the game in their favor.

128,"""Two intelligent people are *more likely* to have an intelligent child, **but it's far from a guarantee.** Same goes for predispositions to talents"" Two intelligent parents having an intelligent child, or two intelligent parents adopting an intelligent child; it's obvious which is more likely. By definition, adopting will give you an average child. And the reasons for why that child is parentless in the first place? Death, poverty, malice, etc... will all influence the child. Did the parents die from sickness? You get a child more predisposed to sickness. Did the parents feel they were too poor to raise a child? You'll get a child that's predisposed to poverty, or at the very least the inability to lift himself up by his bootstraps to get out of an impossible situation (something my family is exceptional at).

8,"I think OP and a lot of people's problem is that intelligence isn't a gender or a sex. It's just a trait. If we had a term for every single preference we had, there would be thousands, if not millions of words for these ""sexual orientations"". And if we don't use the correct one for that person, we're bigots? Please. Think about it. I prefer smaller boobs. But I don't demand to be called, or claim to be a smalltitosexual. I prefer dirty blonde hair, but I'm not a dirtyblondeosexual. I prefer girls who are my height or shorter, but I'm not picketing for shorterthaniamosexual. Everyone has preferences. There's a big difference between a trait preference and a sexual orientation.

120,"I did not say say that satire or any nonliteral statement should be banned. Rather, it should be always obvious from context that it's not true. 
You shouldn't be able to deceive people and then claim you didn't really mean that and they should have realized it was false. Are you familiar with fake news/hoax sites? They're basically an evil version of the Onion. They're far from harmless - often the hoaxes promote racism and other forms of prejudice, so they can actually do serious damage and endanger people. Some of these sites have very small warnings saying the news aren't actually true but 'satire', for legal purposes.. but they are out of the way and the least observant readers aren't going to notice them. I don't see how punishing (and punishment isn't always jail, as in your parents example - there are fines too) people for outright lies damages free speech. 
In fact I would argue for the opposite - the easier it to get away with lying, the less free speech is worth, since people who are telling the truth (or at least being honest and saying what they *believe* is the truth) are less likely to be trusted. After all, if people can lie and not be punished for it, why shouldn't they do that every time it's convenient? Just because there is a grey area such as cases where we suspect the news-spreader knew the news was false, but we can't prove it, doesn't mean *every* case is going to fit in it.",1,"discusses idea that punishing people for mis/disinformation harms free speech, Suggests that protecting harmful satire/free speech comes at the cost of harming and deceiving society",1,"The commenter frames the issue as a zero-sum game where allowing deceptive speech (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of honest speech (loss for truth-tellers), suggesting that one side's gain necessarily results in the other's loss.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames the issue as a zero-sum game where allowing deceptive speech (gain for liars) directly undermines the value and trustworthiness of honest speech (loss for truth-tellers), suggesting that one side's gain necessarily results in the other's loss.""}",2025-08-15_23-25-31

19,"Let me preface this by saying that I understand how tough these kids, and their parents have it; I know it can't be easy for them, and I fully appreciate how much it must genuinely suck for them from time to time. That said, *their* condition is not *our* problem. If this had been some drunk asshole making noise, no one would have a problem with people telling him to shut up, or get out. If it was someone talking on a cellphone, I'm sure this actor's facebook post would've had a much different tone. But because the person disrupting the show is a kid with autism we're expected to just say: ""Oh, that's okay, please feel free to disrupt the performance that I paid $60 to see""? Fuck that. Is it unfair to these kids, absolutely it is, but guess what: *Life isn't fair*. *You* don't get to take it upon yourself to decide that everyone else has to accept your kid's behavior. *You* don't get to decide what other people have to be okay with, or how accommodating or understanding they need to be. Being a parent means that sometimes, you're going to miss out on things because of your kids, being the parent of a special needs child that much more, but that doesn't change the fact that it's your responsibility as a parent to know ahead of time what your kids can or cannot handle, and to then plan accordingly. If you take it upon yourself to say: ""Fuck everyone else, I'll take my kid where I want and they'll just have to deal"", then that's your prerogative, but in doing so you forfeit the right to complain/be offended when people tell you to control your kid, or get the fuck out.",1,"Being a parent of an austistic child requires you to give up living all aspects of life., a gain in ""fairness"" for people with special needs is a loss in fairness to those who otherwise get to expect certain behaviors and punish if those standards aren't met (kicking out alcoholics with bad behavior)",1,"The commenter frames the situation as one where accommodating children with autism at public performances comes at the direct expense of other attendees' enjoyment, implying that any gain in inclusion for one group must result in a loss for the other.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames the situation as one where accommodating children with autism at public performances comes at the direct expense of other attendees' enjoyment, implying that any gain in inclusion for one group must result in a loss for the other.""}",2025-08-15_23-25-31
