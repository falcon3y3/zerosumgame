28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school. ""Formal guidelines on reporting suicide have since been adopted for journalists in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, and Hong Kong."" That's funny, because celebrity suicides are always front page in the US. Who adopted these formal guidelines? What was the mechanism of adoption? Who follows them?",1,"two examples: 1) news cannot self-regulate due to self-interests and 2) better mental health systems will not help people who don't seek it out, if people don't want to do something, it's not worth trying to do it (so if people won't go get mental health care, making more care available won't help, and if they want to keep paying for news, you can't get rid of the money, etc) so for each of this poster's points, the gain is canceled by the loss",0,The comment critiques the effectiveness of various solutions to mass shootings but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one side must result in losses for another; it focuses on practical limitations rather than a strict gain/loss dichotomy between groups.,"{

You shouldn't be able to deceive people and then claim you didn't really mean that and they should have realized it was false. Are you familiar with fake news/hoax sites? They're basically an evil version of the Onion. They're far from harmless - often the hoaxes promote racism and other forms of prejudice, so they can actually do serious damage and endanger people.

In fact I would argue for the opposite - the easier it to get away with lying, the less free speech is worth, since people who are telling the truth (or at least being honest and saying what they *believe* is the truth) are less likely to be trusted.

You're right - it seems pretty crazy to me. Feminists claiming that the statement ""gender equality is for everyone"" is misogynist rhetoric.

90,"""pursue their passions and advance society"" I think you have to make your argument here either or, either you want to value strictly according to the benefit of human kind, or you also value some individual gain which has by itself nothing to do with the progress of mankind.  
I want to challenge the idea itself though, since people are not at all paid in any relation to what they bring to society. The magnitude part ist obvious and you mentioned it already, so I take that as granted. But also the idea that people are gaining roughly to what they bring to humankind is strange to me, someone can be super productive producing landmines and earn a ton, but what exactly is his contribution to society? Compare that to low wage jobs, for example people working with elderly or children..",1,"labor value is based entirely on contributions to the society, Argues that pursuing passions inherently means that society will not advance due to lack of productivity",0,The comment questions the relationship between individual gain and societal benefit but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one group necessarily result in losses for another; it critiques the valuation system rather than presenting it as a zero-sum conflict.,"{

60,"I can't follow your example. It's needlessly complex and not explained thoroughly enough to make sense. I also think the logic is fallacious and rather superfluous. Some simple questions: Why are you producing clocks at different prices if they both sell for 2 dollars? Why are you selling a clock for 3 dollars when you said you could sell it for 5 dollars?  Why are you selling a 3 dollar clock for 2 dollars? Why are you counting only selling the 1 dollar clock for 2 dollars and not counting the 3 dollar clock as a lose since you're forced to sell it for 2 dollars? There's a lot of logical problems with this example and flat out erroneous thinking. I'd like to leave your example behind as it's inherently flawed in both merit and results.The real issue is that wealth is leaving the system in exchange for junk or disposable goods that does not create wealth. The fact that wealth is leaving is bound to create inflation and hurt domestic job creation. It's expedient and looks good initially for the consumer, but like all government policies the expedient good is often met with high costs down the line. Sure, no one argues that free trade creates lower prices for consumers, but it also creates inflation and takes jobs out of the market. So you're going to pay for it one way or the other.Here's my example, I'm paraphrasing from something Warren Buffet once wrote. I can't find the original quote. Lets say we have two island nations. Both island nations have to work 8 hours a day to produce enough food to live off of. Island nation A decides to start working 12 hours a day in order to sell the surplus to island nation B. Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation. This can lead to all sorts of issues, inflation, or island nation A deciding to purchase all the land and businesses from island nation B. This is the intrinsic problem to free trade. You're giving a foreign entity wealth in exchange for worthless junk.",1,"Free trade means countries lose wealth and gain junk, if wealth leaves (free trade, gain) then there will be domestic job creation downturn and inflation (loss)",1,"The comment frames free trade as a scenario where one nation's gain (wealth accumulation by island nation A) is directly tied to another nation's loss (wealth leaving island nation B), presenting the relationship as inherently adversarial and zero-sum.","{
