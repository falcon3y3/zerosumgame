""there are currently more Mexicans leaving the US than arriving (according to Pew Hispanic)"" I guess it's subjective but I find it weird because Mexico is HORRIBLE. Like damn, i've been and they try to rip you off and all that because they're poor they think they're entitled. ""the average Muslim is the same as the average Christian or Jew-- ordinary, peaceful people trying to live their ordinary, peaceful lives and practise their faith privately.""I know, I have no problem with muslims but in the middle east it's a bit different when their religion dictates the law of a country. Islam isn't a ""peaceful"" religion right now. And don't bring up christianity because yes templars were shitty but there's no international terrorists christians blowing people up and throwing gays off buildings. ""Have you ever looked into police brutality statistics against black people; or rape statistics; or inequalities in hiring practises based on race and gender?"" Of course, i'm educated, I KNOW all this shit. I'm not dumb but yeah im self centered because these fuckers would throw me under the bus because their problems are worse than mine because I have more money than them. Also, I used to be enraged but now I don't care because nobody does shit anyways. Protesting with cardboard signs is laughable but so are riots. If I was a corrupt police officer, a cardboard sign won't stop me, and shooting my brethren would make me more inclined to continue. They don't seem to understand the other side which makes me have less sympathy for them. ""Why is it fun to see her fail at her mission of bringing more equality?"" Because she's stupid and wrong about most things. Her ideas are dangerous and she doesn't want ""equality"" she thinks she does but if she had her way it would just be a matriarchy.  ""What do you think Bernie Sanders would tell you if he heard you talking about how you think mass deportations are a good idea because you want to see people you think are too strident not get their way?"" Never said it was a good idea. I'm pro immigration, they do jobs we hate. They pick most our food, they're willing to also do jobs cheaper. I'm just saying IF trump did that then I wouldn't be upset because yes it'd hurt us but hell, we managed to have Hilary V. Trump...kinda shows what kind of people we are as a nation. ""It belies your self-interest again.""
Of course. I have to be selfish because I don't have anyone but myself, yet people still want to take it away and usually those people are SJW's. EVeryones selfish, I promise you that you're selfish too and a lot of what you vote is out of self interest. Fuck, I voted bernie even though he wasn't my self interest but that's because I wanted us to be more like Europe. Now I don't think we'll get to that point. ""Trump has, by all evidence, defrauded people out of millions of dollars. He wants Russian hackers to attack Hillary Clinton."" Ok, well that's not suprising they both want power. I'm honestly not too mad, it's stupid but i'm not that mad. Sorry. I wouldn't be mad if Hilary did the same to Trump. ""The man is an untrustworthy liar, and yet you want to vote for him because you hate teenagers who stand up for minorities too enthusiastically."" They'd be just as dangerous in power and they stand up for minorities who are black, women and mexican. Nobody else. You can be mentally ill, you can be disabled, you can be a severly depressed white man with no legs, you can be a homeless,  you can be a black conservative most of them won't help you. They'll only help and FEEL offended for you if you're skin color is a certain color AND your beliefs are just like theres. In all honesty, I love people and care about people. But it's hard a lot of times because I've learned I have to be selfish most of the time because nobody else really gives a shit about people. And also I'll most likely end up not voting but it's just like even Trump Supporters I meet are less violent and kinder to me than the others. I went to a trump rally, I was on the side of bernie and nobody said shit to me, they just went saying, ""kill all white people"" and smashing cars and fighting with trump supporters and making kids of trump supporters cry. Then I went to the Trump side and got friendly hellos.  I wasn't dressed nice, i was dressed like a protestor would be but still treated WAY better. It's not because im white or male either.

55,"I am opposed to animal abuse. Why? Because I don't think someone should go and kick their dog for barking, or throw rocks at a cat because they think it is funny. These animals did nothing wrong, and intentionally causing them harm does nothing beneficial for anyone while harming the animal. In it's most basic sense, I would consider animal abuse the unnecessary harming of an animal. The key word in that statement is unnecessary. I think that factory farming of meat is a necessary part of our global economy and food source. Just think about what would happen if we somehow magically removed all meat from everyone's diet due to ethical concerns. [The average person eats around 92 pounds of meat per year](http://chartsbin.com/view/12730) and, with your number of 99% coming from factories, let's just say 91 pounds of meat is removed from everyone's diet. How would we possibly get the farmland available to produce 600+ billion pounds of soy product? Is the meat production industry perfect? Not at all, but I recognize it as an necessary fact of global food production, and therefore think it is unreasonable to boycott it as abusive. ",1,"For the global economy to thrive and food sources be maintained, factory farming must exist, hurting animals for no reason is abuse, but hurting animals for a purpose (eating) is not abuse, therefore eating animals is not abuse (gain) and any argument suggesting otherwise is wrong (loss) because there would be a use loss (not enough food)",0,"The comment presents a nuanced perspective on animal welfare that acknowledges complexity and trade-offs, rather than framing the issue as a strict gain/loss scenario between animal rights advocates and meat producers.","{

94," ""What do you mean?"" Well take this quote from MLK's speech at the March on Washington, the high point of the civil rights movement: ""one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."" Or if that doesn't do it for you think of Desmond Tutus idea of a ""rainbow nation"" if you want a non American civil rights figure as an example. Both of these show that the original civil rights movements advocated multi cultural unity, regardless of colour or race. SJW's as we've seen strive for racial segregation, for cultures to never be mixed for fear of ""appropriation"", for in some cases for there to be  racism against whites as payback for past discrimination against blacks. All rather against MLKs and others visions no? ""If you think it is an ""institutionalized conspiracy"" then you don't really understand what people are talking about. They're not saying there's a secret cabal of white men keeping everyone down."" No they're advocating that the entire system, sometimes the entirety of Western civilisation, is built on institutionalised racism and a load of other isms. ""I'm a white man, and nobody has ever made me feel like I've committed some original sin by being born."" You've never heard of ""check your privilege""? It assigns automatic guilt and fault to someone regardless of actions, rather like the religious concept of original sin. To move away from racial privilege I consider myself an ally of the LGBT movement yet some people would say that simply supporting LGBT rights wouldn't be enough. I'd have to check my straight privilege, understand how I might ""oppress"" others etc. Again rather like original sin. ""People bash fat people just for existing all the time. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to that very notion."" How? Advocating a healthy lifestyle and suggesting that one should aspire not to be unhealthily over weight is simply the truth if that's what you mean by bashing. If you mean r/fatpeoplehate when you say a sub it got banned a long time ago and had what? A few hundred users, many of whom were satirical. ""No, it would not. Segregation and Jim Crow was a whole institution aimed at keeping black people as second class citizens. This doesn't do anything of the sort, it's just a space for a group of people to congregate. Do I necessarily think that racially segregated safe spaces are a good thing? Not really, but not for some bullshit ""we're going back to Jim Crow!"" alarmism."" The entire concept was ""separate but equal"", isn't that what SJW's seek to resurrect with their idea of segregation? ""They're like movie ratings, just a way for people who avoid topics that might cause them distress if it pops up out of nowhere."" And how far should this go? I mean ""I'm offended"" is used to shutdown entire debates. Maybe no one cares if it upsets you and unless you have very real PTSD there's no excuse as an adult to try and shut someone else up based on your convictions. ""Could you tell me what some of these ""actual facts"" are that people are trying to avoid in safe spaces?"" Basic biology? No you don't have ""headmates"" who share your body, you need to seek medical help. No, biological sex isn't a social construct. Common sense? No, otherkin can't really have the soul of a dragon or wolf. ""There's this idea out there that every single area needs to be widely open to all discussions all the time. 
We're talking about campuses here, not even dorms or private rooms or whatever. Areas meant for discussion.

&gt;But that's just not the case. Do you get upset at funerals when you can't spend the whole time bashing the deceased? Do you think that weddings are an affront to free speech just because the group won't tolerate you giving the bride and groom shit?

Strawman. I'm not arguing for the right to say what you want where ever. I'm talking about not using offense or safe spaces to shutdown legitimate debates.

&gt;As a straight white cis man, I can just fuckin' go to a school cafeteria and nobody will give me shit for who I am or claim that my gender isn't real or talk about how I and people like me are more prone to violence.
