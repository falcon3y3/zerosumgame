50,"""Certainly this sort of language is not conducive to actual understanding.""I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing. Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)). Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it. ""Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face."" I can point you to some subs here on reddit, if you want, where a majority of the users don't believe this.

Bullshit. There is nothing we can do to change the actual past, but there is plenty we can do going forward.

Let's pretend that this is actually about language and/or method of the message. Why is being condescending off the table?

You understand how debilitating marginalization is, right? It seems to me this call for politeness is still the dominate group setting the rules of the game in their favor.

141,"""You're proposing _laws_ that in my mind would  hinder the capacity of a great number of  people  to maximize the good they do with their money"" Let's not kid ourselves here. If you want to talk about people as a whole and not yourself, then accept the fact that the rich do not give as charitably as you think. A household making $50,000 or less actually gives MORE of their wealth as a percentage of income than the rich do. https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/548537/ If the rich were all such altruistic charitable folk, then I would never dream of trying to create some sort of system to force them to stop being such selfish assholes. But the facts are clear: most rich people have zero interest in doing what you're doing. Most will hoard that money for generations while the sick and the hungry continue to die needlessly. Honestly I don't give an iota of a shit what happens to the economy or how difficult this is to implement. The far greater sin is already happening right now, where people are literally starving to death when they really didn't have to just because H. Trust fund Jones the 3rd wanted a fucking yacht. There really are few things in this world more absurd than that.",1,"All rich people are inherently anti-altruistic, This author argues that by allowing wealthy people to remain wealthy without enforcing some way of having them share some money for social good, they will harm those who are not as wealthy by hoarding money and resources",1,"The comment frames wealth redistribution as a direct zero-sum conflict between rich and poor, implying that any gains for the poor must come at the direct expense of the wealthy, with language suggesting a strict win/lose dynamic around economic resources.","{

151,"""What does this look like though?"" Humans are eventually rendered to the point they no longer understand or can comprehend the past, past technology, or even handle everyday proclivities because everything has been done for them for countless generations, even *unique thinking.* ""What are you trying to say? What possibilities? How are they being destroyed? You're being exceptionally vague and inflammatory here."" Look at Rome subsequently followed by the dark ages of disarray, war, disease, and lack of comprehension towards technologies that helped human life in the past. ""And is the pursuit of happiness wrong? Why do you think scientists ever pursued their discoveries in the first place? Progress makes many people happy. That isn't going to stop suddenly, and I don't think you have the evidence to conclude that it'll even happen gradually."" The juxtaposition you most likely ignore in daily life is that the pursue of happiness always curtails itself on the inevitability of oppressing someone else. You will never have your cake and eat it to. These models have successfully been constructed into the lives of our ancestors, but now we have technologies and agencies trying to deny this natural implementation. It *won't* end well if everyone get's their cake and eats it too. ""This study has been misinterpreted ever since it came out, as said by one of the authors herself. In her words"" You only prove my point. A scientific consensus is met with the pressures of a social society to the point where a statement needs to be made, dampening the overall outcomes. ""It seems you've fallen prey to junk data."" The irony is palpable. ""Because liposuction is maladaptive, feeds into the disorder, and worsens the health of the individual. Gender reassignment resolves people's gender dysphoria.""Well, the suicide, anxiety, and depression rates hold the opposite. Really, think about it. A person changes their sex and enters this current world. Do you ever think they can use ""tinder"" like a biological counter-part? The overall end-game will never been accomplished because of useless bull-worth like this.

85,"I'm not going to pretend to know the intimate details of the movie audio business, but I do know a little bit about business in general. For example, if you're in a field that is over-saturated with talent the result is going to be low pay. You're expendable. If someone can do the same job for cheaper, they're going to get the job. In this sort of market, where there is an army of young interns who will go *Swimming with Sharks* for your job, the lack of professionalism demonstrated by slipping in a sound effect that detracts from the film should be a deal-breaker for future work. The higher competition and lower wages doesn't justify personal acts of sabotage.
