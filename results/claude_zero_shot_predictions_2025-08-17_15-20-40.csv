27,"First off, it is impossible to acquire food without disrupting and causing the deaths of some animals in some way.  Monoculture crop feilds make for horrible habitat for just about everything, farm runoff can [destroy entire ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_pollution), farmers shoot a large number of animals who would eat the crops, and so on.  Under ideal circumstances, livestock and hunting can provide an extremely environmentally friendly way of getting food on the plate, and I see no reason to cut it out of my diet.  It is important to note that I see a value in the total assemblage of life in an ecosystem to be of far more value than the sum of the individuals.  I have no issue with harming a few for the purpose of the greater good. Secondly, why do you draw the line at animals?  Everything you eat was once living, and I see no aspect that applies to all animals but does not apply to any plants or fungus.  To me, cutting out all animals from my diet is completely arbitrary and serves so purpose.  I can see potential arguments that will apply to specific groups of animals, and I expect that you will make them, but that if vastly different than the stance in the OP.",1,"People consuming food requires disruption/death of animals, you either acknowledge that what you eat was once living and by eating you will be causing the death of something, or you are making up arbitrary moral goalposts and standards that can't be lived up to",0,"The comment presents a nuanced perspective on ecosystem interactions and food systems, acknowledging complexity and avoiding strict binary framing.

You could replace all the individuals within the political system and it wouldn't really change the situation on the long term (same causes, same effects)."" Would you say it's okay to say that an individual good person is considered at fault for being in such a system (especially if it was at a system where they had no choice to be considered a member of)? It seems you are somewhat unfamiliar with the situation going on (or so I assume from how you write) so I can't necessarily give a good or unbiased summary, but I do personally see some stuff like that quite a bit in regards to social justice.

My Master's thesis was on a similar topic, analyzing quality of life and depression in nurses.  Those who chose a glass of wine, watching TV, or relaxing in a bath had significantly lower quality of life and significantly higher incidence of depression (p&lt;0.05 on both).  It is a choice not to exercise and it is a choice to make excuses.  It is also a choice to suck it up and meet the minimum physical activity guidelines of 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week of moderate to high intensity physical activity.
