141,"""You're proposing _laws_ that in my mind would  hinder the capacity of a great number of  people  to maximize the good they do with their money"" Let's not kid ourselves here. If you want to talk about people as a whole and not yourself, then accept the fact that the rich do not give as charitably as you think. A household making $50,000 or less actually gives MORE of their wealth as a percentage of income than the rich do. https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/548537/ If the rich were all such altruistic charitable folk, then I would never dream of trying to create some sort of system to force them to stop being such selfish assholes. But the facts are clear: most rich people have zero interest in doing what you're doing. Most will hoard that money for generations while the sick and the hungry continue to die needlessly. Honestly I don't give an iota of a shit what happens to the economy or how difficult this is to implement. The far greater sin is already happening right now, where people are literally starving to death when they really didn't have to just because H. Trust fund Jones the 3rd wanted a fucking yacht. There really are few things in this world more absurd than that.",1,"All rich people are inherently anti-altruistic, This author argues that by allowing wealthy people to remain wealthy without enforcing some way of having them share some money for social good, they will harm those who are not as wealthy by hoarding money and resources",1.0,"The author frames the issue as a direct tradeoff: the wealth hoarded by the rich comes at the expense of the poor, who suffer and die as a result; any gain for the rich is depicted as a loss for the needy.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The author frames the issue as a direct tradeoff: the wealth hoarded by the rich comes at the expense of the poor, who suffer and die as a result; any gain for the rich is depicted as a loss for the needy.""}",2025-08-16_11-23-43
135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.

I want to challenge the idea itself though, since people are not at all paid in any relation to what they bring to society. The magnitude part ist obvious and you mentioned it already, so I take that as granted. But also the idea that people are gaining roughly to what they bring to humankind is strange to me, someone can be super productive producing landmines and earn a ton, but what exactly is his contribution to society?

78,"""That is done in two ways: by highlighting the ways in which identity generates unfavorable treatment for unprivileged groups, and by highlighting the way identity generates favorable treatment for privileged groups."" And where exactly is the middle ground, the default? Privileged people are treated unfairly beneficially, and unprivileged people are disadvantaged. Where is the group that is neither unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged? What is the base level of human treatment that is not unfair? That's a big part of my issue is that there really is no room for a base treatment, if someone is treated somewhat better, everyone else is now unprivileged in comparison. There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups? That there are people who are chosen because of their identity, privileged, people not chosen because of their identity, unprivileged, and those who are chosen/not chosen not due to identity, default or neutral. By conflating groups the first and last groups you just seem to making bigger issues and suggests that the solution is something entirely different. Sorry, but if the discussion on privilege refuses to recognize that concept, I have to say it's designed to pit two groups against each other and create animosity rather than cooperation. ""It's not about revenge - it's about acknowledgement."" May I ask how ""punching up"" and ""Male tears"" are exactly acknowledgement? Don't you feel that constant language such as oppressors and privilege are going to make people get upset at these groups and associate them with such terms negatively? Even if it isn't about revenge in it's base concept, it certainly seems to be breeding a lot of hostility and anger through how it chooses to get across it's message. ""These people don't deserve to be treated better than us, they oppress us. they hurt us!"" It certainly creates an attitude among people that could be pretty easy to get lost in don't you agree? ""That's why you'll certainly see discussion of privilege, but the highest levels of frustration with unexamined privilege. Too many members of privileged groups (the same groups that hold social, political, and economic power) either don't see or refuse to acknowledge the way privilege affects their life."" And just a personal gripe, but that's part of my own issue with the movement, they only care for some privileges. How many people who prominently do end up supporting Social Justice end up being from some pretty rich backgrounds (see for example, the man who did the hunger strike recently, who is the son of a multi-millionaire), yet seemingly ignore wealth as a privilege. It seems so common a phrase to say ""those who have privilege can't see it"" but they never seem to take that mean that they should potentially direct the lens back at themselves. I mean, in regards to issues with women, do you ever see female privilege as an idea ever pop up?

Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification?

Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart?

If you spent that little bit of time to look it up, you would know perfectly well why there is backlash. It isn't a double standard, since AllLivesMatter and WhiteLivesMatter are nothing but excuses to dismiss black people and their strife.

To a certain extent, indeed. This is the crux of the /r/SRS vs Reddit at Large movement. To what extent do we owe other people the right to not be offended at the expense of our own expression. I might counter to a close friend offended by something I said that, ""I don't like it when you put your personal negative connotations associated with language on my expression."" Obviously there's some kind of line to be drawn. It's unreasonable for me to shout ""nigger"" in Times Square and be self-righteous about people being offended. But what if I say a white lady practicing yoga is culturally appropriating from Asian culture? Being that ""gay"" as an insult so ubiquitous among self-identified not-homophobes, I think it's unreasonable for someone to assume that calling something ""gay"" is necessarily bigoted. It may make you uncomfortable. It may imply bigotry, just as me saying ""bitch"" might imply misogyny. If I stub my toe and shout ""bitch"" it's probably not very indicative of anything.

The statement about it highlighted issues like male-underachivement in university (which is true in all Western countries), male suicide and mental health (men are far more likely to commit suicide than women, etc. You can read the original statement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3t1l7p/university_of_york_cancels_international_mens_day/cx2ah47). In response - a few hundred feminists at the university wrote a bigoted and self-serving letter to the university condemning International Men's Day, and saying that it was bad because it did not address women's issues (which was obviously the point). Which you can [read here](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2015/11/16/open-letter-blasts-universitys-decision-to-mark-international-mens-day-read-it-here/).
