76,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso ""It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain"" Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially. Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy. Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them. The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them. I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking. ""I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them"" Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche. I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit. I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good. The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior.

The same is true for African Americans and other people of color. In addition, men are punished merely for rape *accusations*. They are kicked out of school, shunned by their friends and family, fired from their jobs, and generally disregarded by society.  Even if it is proven that the claim was fake, many parts of society says ""there is probably more to the story, she is just being too nice to drop charges, etc"" and they still suffer.

107,"""Aka: I have no argument, I just wanna hate on those Evil Feminist"" I've presented detailed arguments and there is nothing wrong with hating evil people. Don't want me to hate you? Convince me that you and your group aren't as evil as my experience of you suggests. Don't act as if I'm being absurd for judging you when the evidence I have says your ideology is fucking awful. ""Personally I don't view a single opinion article and one organization (which does have programs for men fyi) as enough support to say ""all of western society accepts this"".""I didn't say all of western society accepts it. I said it was a position held by feminist groups. What is the critical number of articles you need to be convinced that it is actually a thing that feminists advocate for? ""Regardless, every feminist I know, myself included, is against the prison complex that does hurt men..."" Yes, sure you are. Every men's issue is totally a concern for feminists when their failure to address them is rubbed in their faces by anti-feminists. The moment you aren't arguing with us, suddenly it doesn't seem to be quite so pressing. But feel free to link me to all the feminists campaigning for equal prison time. I'm sure it's a far more significant issue for you than manspreading or sexy video game characters so there will be plenty of campaigns about it. I like the way you are 'against the prison complex' rather than the discrimination. So we should be sending fewer people to prison in general? Of course, when an issue mostly affects women, feminists make sure that all the support is given to women. When it mostly affect men, then it's time to treat *everyone* better. ""...why is it a zero sum game?"" Because people like you declared war on people like me and turned everything into a battle. ""Why can't everyone go to jail less?""
Because some of them are fucking dangerous criminals, maybe? ""I wonder why? MRAs paint this huge anti-feminist picture and then expect feminist to just join in.

MRA groups don't exactly treat feminist groups kindly either.""The evidence says that feminism is a fucking awful movement and deserves to be treated like shit. You refuse to debate. You try and shut down any discussion you can't control. You spread lies about groups fighting for equality. You pull fire alarms, call in bomb threats, protest anyone who dares to question you. Your forums are full of nonsense and hatred. How exactly do you expect to be treated? ""So what you're saying is that since feminist don't call out women rapist specifically but rather all, that's somehow wrong?"" Do you think that 'all lives matter' is a good response to 'black lives matter'? How about 'all lives matter, but every single example we give of a specific life which matters happens to be white'?
