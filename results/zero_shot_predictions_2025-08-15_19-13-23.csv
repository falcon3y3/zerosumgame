168,"""but there is never a good reason to cheat."" To paraphrase Dan Savage a bit: what should a person whose spouse is dying of cancer do? Or a a person whose spouse is still alive, but is brain dead because of some horrible accident? Should they just go without sex, no matter how crazy and depressed that lack of intimacy makes them? Or the alternative, should that person divorce their sick and dying spouse so they can go get a few minutes or hours of sexual gratification? That sexual gratification that then makes it bearable to go home, and face the reality of having to care for a person until they die?Or let's say you have children, and you don't want to tear your family apart, but your spouse refuses to have sex with you anymore? Should you just suffer silently, while they hold you hostage in a miserable marriage? Or does a little bit a very discreet cheating, enough to keep you sane, prevent you from splitting up your children? What's worse? A little bit of extramarital sex, or splitting your family apart? Dan Savage says it much better than me, but cheating isn't always as black and white. Yeah, cheating is really bad, but sometimes it's the least worst option. Should a person trying to keep their family together without being depressed and miserable all the time, but gets caught, also be penalized without a livable income when they are on their own?

There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy.

You are more likely to kill yourself, divorce, have fewer friends and be generally depressed. This is because suburbia is horrible, fundamentally. Fact. Denser cities are always cheaper and better.

This was an academic report by knowledgable people. The only dissent was the degree to which there as an effect, not IF there was an effect. 3. Your conclusions are flawed and I'll need you to seriously read and listen to the 2+ hours of dialogue and supporting material. Theres no way you could have done that. 4. If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16. Sounds like you don't like the evidence. Not my problem. Did you miss this part? http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/16/shock-flashback-obama-says-illegal-immigration-hurts-blue-collar-americans-strains-welfare-video/ 17. what sort of meandering argument is this? 18. It doesn't create new jobs. It displaces many and those which it creates is supplanted by the false labor market size that doesn't reflect the real influence of illegal immigrant pressure on the resources and society at large 19. You're complaining about a time stamp? 20. You can't point to some shitty HTML website that doesnt even have a wells fargo logo on it and pretend you're trotting out an equitable argument. Fact is, illegals are getting the red carpet.  21. what? 22. This was an academic report by knowledgable people. The only dissent was the degree to which there as an effect, not IF there was an effect.  23. This was an academic report by knowledgable people.
