And where exactly is the middle ground, the default? Privileged people are treated unfairly beneficially, and unprivileged people are disadvantaged. Where is the group that is neither unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged? What is the base level of human treatment that is not unfair? That's a big part of my issue is that there really is no room for a base treatment, if someone is treated somewhat better, everyone else is now unprivileged in comparison. There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups? That there are people who are chosen because of their identity, privileged, people not chosen because of their identity, unprivileged, and those who are chosen/not chosen not due to identity, default or neutral.

Don't you feel that constant language such as oppressors and privilege are going to make people get upset at these groups and associate them with such terms negatively?
