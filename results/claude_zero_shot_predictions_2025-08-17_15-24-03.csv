76,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso ""It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain"" Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially. Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy. Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them. The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them. I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking. ""I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them"" Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche. I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit. I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good. The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior.

But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

I mean don't get me wrong I couldn't give a fuck about the species at the moment we have conquered the world  and even if 50% of the population was gay we would continue to grow and strive.

Award shows - if you are in America, turn on the tv! We just had the BET show for example. Parades - We have black pride parades. Chinese New Year too but that feels more inclusive of all peoples. Maybe I'm just feeling left out because I'm white, lol! Idk, for all the talk about how racism and discrimination are bad, things like this feel designed to promote those very ideas. ""Is it not feasible to fight the idea that we are supposed to be different based on color or religion, if that's what causing racism?"" But I don't think we are fighting that idea as a whole. We create clubs and award shows as a defense against racism, but I would argue that much of the time it does the opposite because it excludes everyone else. It promotes segregation and exclusion of other groups by its very existence. It's counter-intuitive. Yet if a person or group seeks to speak in support of another group, it's often interpreted as placating and patronizing.

If you want to talk about people as a whole and not yourself, then accept the fact that the rich do not give as charitably as you think. A household making $50,000 or less actually gives MORE of their wealth as a percentage of income than the rich do. https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/548537/ If the rich were all such altruistic charitable folk, then I would never dream of trying to create some sort of system to force them to stop being such selfish assholes. But the facts are clear: most rich people have zero interest in doing what you're doing. Most will hoard that money for generations while the sick and the hungry continue to die needlessly. Honestly I don't give an iota of a shit what happens to the economy or how difficult this is to implement.
