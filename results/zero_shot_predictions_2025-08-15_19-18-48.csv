Your conclusions are flawed and I'll need you to seriously read and listen to the 2+ hours of dialogue and supporting material. Theres no way you could have done that. 4. If the President of Mexico thinks blacks are not only capable of doing shitty work, but somehow mexicans are doing things that ""blacks won't do"" then that means he's fully complicit in the systematic displacement of black labor, which demands citizen pay and legal protections in favor of illegals. 5. This again is a mistruth. Black laborers shouldn't have had to combine with illegal communities just to maintain a competitive edge in the labor market. 6. I'm saying that if minority hires are considered, then statistically its likely that job would have gone to a black candidate, not an illegal hispanic immigrant. 7. If you're changing the terms to ones which obfuscate your illegal status, then your'e vying for political and emotional legitimacy at the expense of american citizens. 8. because black illegal immigrants are small groups of people who still entered the country legally and exist on paper somewhere. Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16.
