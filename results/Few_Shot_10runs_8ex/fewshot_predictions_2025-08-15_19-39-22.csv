123,You honestly are attempting to argue that Islam is compatible with western culture? Sharia councils are used in Muslim countries and in the UK as a sort of tribunal to settle disputes within Islam. We have a very different legal system founded from secular roots. Under no circumstances should an Islamic council of any sort be allowed to issue an judgement in a western country and there is not s single reason any Muslim apologist can give to the contrary. Turkey has traditionally been a fault line between the west and the Islamic world. Attaturk was a secularist and you are referencing a Turkey that is been purged away in front of us as we speak. Erdogan is an Islamist. His political party endorse political Islam. That is in no way compatible with our legal system. Would you want an Islamist political party standing for election in a Western European nation or the US? If you say yes then in my eyes you are trying to destroy the very country you live in. A Muslim can only live in the west if they assimilate. They must accept that the laws and culture of the country they live in are superior to their own. If they come to this country they best accept our laws and speak English. This is the only way they can become an American. ,1,"Anyone who identifies as muslim can only live in the western society if they abandon their culture and assimilate fully, Suggests that the promotion of Islamic culture comes at the cost of culture in the UK/US",1,"The commenter frames the situation as a strict incompatibility: either Western culture and legal systems prevail (gain) and Islamic practices are rejected (loss for Muslims), or allowing Islamic councils or political parties is seen as a direct threat and loss to Western society, with no possibility of coexistence or mutual benefit.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The commenter frames the situation as a strict incompatibility: either Western culture and legal systems prevail (gain) and Islamic practices are rejected (loss for Muslims), or allowing Islamic councils or political parties is seen as a direct threat and loss to Western society, with no possibility of coexistence or mutual benefit.""}",2025-08-15_19-39-22

There can be no base level because as soon as there is someone above or below it, we have created a huge dichotomy. To say that one may be treated for their efforts is unfair treatment when another is discriminated for identity is just not right. Wouldn't it better to look at it along the lines of 3 groups?
