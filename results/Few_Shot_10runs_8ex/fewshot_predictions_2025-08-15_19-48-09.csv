20,"""Shame that we have to accomodate for people with disabilities, right?"" First of all, there is a difference between making accommodations for people with disabilities, and allowing someone with a disability to ruin something for everyone else. Second, it's the *businesses* responsibility to make any accommodations, **not the other customers**. If a theater wants to have a show just for special needs guests, that's great. If they want to have a ""kids"" show, I'm all for it. But when you have a show, with 300 - 400 people in a theater, who've paid anywhere from $60 - $250 to see a show, it is ridiculous to tell them: ""You just need to be more understanding"", when they complain about a kid yelling, and screaming, and ""yipping"" in the audience. That said, the whole ""If a person acts out, they can be removed"" argument is just ridiculous, especially when we're talking about one of the most foreseeable problems a parent will ever face. Not to mention that it's still going to disrupt the show that hundreds of people paid to see; one person does not have the right to ruin a show for everyone else, *regardless* of what their situation is.

The fact that you think Israel deflecting their disgusting actions is relevant to this conversation shows how biased you are.

28,"""Please CMV if you can! But I think this would be beneficial to society and easier to get done than gun control or better mental healthcare.""I had a discussion about this with a friend of mine over the weekend. These were our conclusions: 1. It doesn't make sense that it would be ""easier"" or more desirable to further restrict/repeal the 1st amendment than the 2nd. The fact that you and I are aware that people have linked news coverage to motive for mass killings is a direct result of news reporting, after all. I have read articles similar to the one you linked in the WSJ.
""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof""; **or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press**; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn't make sense that news organizations will be reliably self-regulatory because there is a profit motive in most news reporting. People *want* to know about the killer and his guns and his mental health and his posts on 4chan and how/if people encouraged him and suchlike. Answering those questions (for hours on end, probably with a theme song) makes money and sells toothpaste and Viagra. 3. It doesn't make sense that the news consuming public will be reliably self-regulatory by ""voting with their feet"" and not consuming this content as a signal to advertisers. If you stop by CNN/MSNBC/FOX/CBS/NBC/ABC to find out about, say, Syria, you *will* see news on the shooting. So the only ""reasonable"" response to stop consuming news for the week or two after an incident because there aren't really any reliable methods to signal your desire to not see this *particular* news. You can't buy half of a newspaper and Nielsen reporting on watching 24-hour coverage is probably not as fine grained as one might desire. And, honestly, people *do* want to see it, regardless of the possible consequences. Just like people want their guns, apparently. See: selling toothpaste and Viagra to the public.4. It's funny, but better mental health care probably won't do much, either. Fully 2/3rds of recent mass shooters have never had contact with the mental health profession. They may have actually needed it, but it's not like most of them were already in care and the professionals just missed the danger or their potential intentions. Better mental health care won't help people who don't seek it. The majority of recent shooters were described as male loners who were victims of bullying, had few friends, and were obsessed with guns and gun culture. This would describe the majority of guys I hung with in high school (we were the weirdos who smoked together before school and liked to talk about our favorite metal bands), and none of them shot up the school.

Saying you don't accept your gender for liberty is no different than saying you don't accept that you're human for cynical reasons. I'm not human, I feel like a meerkat. That doesn't make sense.

But we are talking about who is more aggressive here and since I don't see the other side making similar statements, I have to say that even if you were 100% right and I agreed with your statement completely, it would still be the more aggressive position of the two.

82,"I think if you are at the point where you are giving gifts primarily to avoid the awkwardness of giving nothing, it's time to have a conversation about not wanting to do the gift thing any more. I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving. Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens. Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility. I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value! There's also problems with it, and it's not for every relationship, but this is a fundamental argument for gift giving.",1,"Asking for money as a gift devalues the gift giver and renders it a practical exchange , Asking for money instead of gifts will upset the gift-giver and reduce the overall value of the gift",0,The comment discusses the pros and cons of different gift-giving practices without framing the issue as one party's gain being another's loss; it focuses on the value and enjoyment of gift giving rather than a strict gain/loss scenario.,"{""zero_sum"": 0, ""justification"": ""The comment discusses the pros and cons of different gift-giving practices without framing the issue as one party's gain being another's loss; it focuses on the value and enjoyment of gift giving rather than a strict gain/loss scenario.""}",2025-08-15_19-48-09
