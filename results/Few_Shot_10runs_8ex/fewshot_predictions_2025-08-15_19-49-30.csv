Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation.

204,"Although the BMI chart talks about people above a certain mass for their height being overweight or obese, this is not always true. Most professional  rugby players count as obese or at least overweight, and yet are healthier than a majority of the population  due to physical fitness and lifestyle. This is a confounding factor in the whole obesity/mortality figures, as any athlete in this situation is obese on the chart without actually being obese, due to the lack of complexity of the BMI analysis of health.

45,"No it doesn't. But how many people are actually really trying to get better at a demanding skill? Not a lot apparently since job boards are looking and taking dam near any body nowadays. Those that can't, get the support they need to get by but if they want a grander life they have to break the box and do things beyond their limitations.

85,"I'm not going to pretend to know the intimate details of the movie audio business, but I do know a little bit about business in general. For example, if you're in a field that is over-saturated with talent the result is going to be low pay. You're expendable. If someone can do the same job for cheaper, they're going to get the job. In this sort of market, where there is an army of young interns who will go *Swimming with Sharks* for your job, the lack of professionalism demonstrated by slipping in a sound effect that detracts from the film should be a deal-breaker for future work. The higher competition and lower wages doesn't justify personal acts of sabotage. In fact, I think it does a lot to advance the opposite argument.",1,"Audio engineers who sneak sound effects into movies are sabotaging the film, Argues that allowing for low barriers to entry into a space will lead to worse conditions for those who work there",0,"The comment discusses market competition and professionalism, but does not frame the situation as one where gains for one group must directly result in losses for another; rather, it describes general market forces and individual responsibility.","{""zero_sum"": 0, ""justification"": ""The comment discusses market competition and professionalism, but does not frame the situation as one where gains for one group must directly result in losses for another; rather, it describes general market forces and individual responsibility.""}",2025-08-15_19-49-30
