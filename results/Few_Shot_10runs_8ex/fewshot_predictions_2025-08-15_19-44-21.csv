76,"As a bit of a qualifier, I do agree that corporal punishment *as it is commonly practiced* is inappropriate. However, disagree that it is *a priori* harmful, and will move forward with that proviso ""It teaches kids that in order to get people to do what you want, you should inflict pain"" Applied broadly, this idea would make any punishment inappropriate. Time outs or grounding: in order to get people to do what you want, you should isolate them socially. Taking away of privileges or games: in order to get people to do what you want, you should deprive them of things they enjoy. Forced public apologies and reparation: in order to get people to do what you want, you should publicly humiliate them. The fundamental purpose of any punishment should be to condition a negative response to a certain stimulus, not merely to inflict your will upon another. The tricky part comes in dealing with which stimulus the child ends up associating with a punishment response. The research I have read (and please understand this is not extensive. I have only a BS in psychology, and avoided much developmental psych. I was focused more on the neurobiology of psychology than behavioral psych) is almost all based on survey data and is inherently biased. Those who most strongly remember being spanked were spanked inappropriately, and associated their punishment not with whatever caused the spanking, but with the emotional state of the parent who spanked them. I do not know of any research that focuses on spanking as a passionless consequence of rule breaking. ""I believe it also causes kids to fear their parents... it isn't fair to essentially attack kids because you are angry with them"" Again, this is a problem with the application of corporal punishment, rather than its merit. If you are hitting your child because you are angry with them, or in order to show dominance, then these statements are certainly true, and you are likely being abusive. The same is also true if you yell at a child and send them to their room, or force them to sit in a corner and cry. It is the attitude of the punisher, not the punishment (within reason, certainly. Calmly punching your child is still clearly abusive) that can harm the child's psyche. I am going to give some personal information now, and you may well ignore it as anecdotal (and will in fact cover two points you raised above regarding children being different and how I was spanked as a child), but I have found nothing that counters its merit. I grew up with a sister and a step sister. I was imaginative and precocious. Time outs, grounding, and deprivation were nothing to me, as I lived mostly in my own head anyway. No punishment was sufficiently onerous to me to alter my behavior in any way. My sisters, however, could not stand these punishments, and feared them greatly. Finally, my stepfather and mother told me that, for certain offenses, I would be spanked. What qualified as a spanking offense was made clear to me, and a promise was made that I would never be spanked in anger. The same deal was made with my sisters because they wanted to be fair, but each was only ever spanked once, as it was clear to both of my parents that they suffered much too greatly in relation to the severity of the crimes they were punished for. I was spanked with fair (though decreasing) regularity as a child. And each time, I feared the spanking, though I suspect no more than my sisters feared time outs. I never feared my stepfather outside of the times I knew I was going to be spanked, and I always knew ahead of time because I knew the rules. He never hit me while angry, and he always made sure that I knew that I was being punished for what I did, not for what I was. I never felt shame or humiliation at being spanked, and was never told it was for my own good. The long and the short of it is that I learned that my actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences are unpleasant. I agree that most parents don't approach spanking this way, and the way that most parents do approach it is wrong. But if approached dispassionately, with clearly defined boundaries, it is one of the strongest ways to condition a child's behavior.

To begin with, there's no scientific consensus on the definition of intelligence, nor is there any accurate way to measure or categorize it in humans (let alone non-humans).
