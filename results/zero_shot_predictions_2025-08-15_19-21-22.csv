50,"""Certainly this sort of language is not conducive to actual understanding.""I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing. Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)). Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it. ""Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face.""

Let's pretend that this is actually about language and/or method of the message. Why is being condescending off the table? Why is it such a bad tactic, especially when no one seriously cares to hear what you have to say otherwise (particularly when it falls outside of the dominate narrative)? You understand how debilitating marginalization is, right? It seems to me this call for politeness is still the dominate group setting the rules of the game in their favor. Why should the subordinated group not try to find other ways to get a voice, outside of the ""acceptable ways of discourse"" determined for them? Why should they not be mad and frustrated? What have they got to lose when they are mostly silenced anyways?",1,"Telling marginalized groups to ask for reparations more politely is doing them a disservice; re position of poster, sets up following framework: people don't want reparations because they feel it can only exist if they take responsbility or blame for past crimes/ slavery , argument for reparations being met with all white people are responsible for all problems, the idea being you can either fester in the past or move forward clean in the future, no middle ground",1,"The comment frames the situation as one where the gains of one group (inherited wealth from wrongdoing) are directly tied to the losses of another, and justice is described as redressing this imbalance, which is a classic zero-sum framing.","{

9,"When we have cases like the mattress girls, a very complicated case which arguably is a crying wolf scenario, it becomes very difficult to take these surveys at face value. What type of an affect does constantly talking about things such as rape culture have on these surveys? Wouldn't there have to be a certain number which are stretches of the definition, or encounters which were as much convoluted communication as they were assault?",1,"Talking about rape culture more often comes at the cost of people confusing encounters as rape even when they are not, Argues that having public discussions about rape and the harms of rape makes it more difficult to actually pinpoint cases of rape",0,"The comment questions the reliability of surveys and the impact of discourse on definitions, but it does not frame the issue as one group's gain being another's loss in a strict zero-sum manner.","{

10,"""Doesn't the fact that you are trying so hard to disbelieve or discredit 13% of female seniors stating they were penetrated without consent (which was clearly defined in the survey and not open to misinterpretation) suggest the existence of rape culture? Not in the least, especially considering your next argument. ""Based on no evidence other than one extreme case that gained national attention for being so controversial, and your *assumption* that large numbers of women at 27 colleges exaggerated or lied on the survey, you are trying to to argue that 13% of women reporting nonconsensual penetration is a language problem, not a rape/assault problem. That goes way, way beyond healthy or reasonable skepticism."" If there is one who exaggerated, there are two, where there are two there are theee. Why do we continually see false rape culture examples? UVA , Lena Dunham, mattress girl ect. Every high profile case in the past year has been shown to be false, hardly a one off occurance, and yet we're supposed to pretend there's a culture of rape? If anything popular culture over the past year has shown there is a culture of false rape accusations.

90,"""pursue their passions and advance society"" I think you have to make your argument here either or, either you want to value strictly according to the benefit of human kind, or you also value some individual gain which has by itself nothing to do with the progress of mankind.  
I want to challenge the idea itself though, since people are not at all paid in any relation to what they bring to society. The magnitude part ist obvious and you mentioned it already, so I take that as granted. But also the idea that people are gaining roughly to what they bring to humankind is strange to me, someone can be super productive producing landmines and earn a ton, but what exactly is his contribution to society? Compare that to low wage jobs, for example people working with elderly or children..",1,"labor value is based entirely on contributions to the society, Argues that pursuing passions inherently means that society will not advance due to lack of productivity",0,The comment questions the relationship between individual gain and societal benefit but does not frame the issue as one where gains for one group necessarily result in losses for another; it critiques value assignment rather than positing a strict gain/loss dichotomy.,"{

73,"""someone can dislike the label of feminism without being against women's rights"" What is ""the label of feminism"" though? What does that even mean? Either you're against feminism itself, or you're not. If you're against feminism that means you *stand against the struggle for gender equality*. It means you want men to remain in a position of privilege in society. Its like saying ""Im pro-racism but im not racist"". ""People can dislike the actions done under the label of feminism, and thus be anti-feminism"" You can dislike stereotypical tumblr feminists without being against feminism though, cant you? Since those people make up a small minority of all feminists it doesnt make sense to be anti-feminism. It makes about as much sense as being anti-white people because of all the school shootings.",1,"Articulates point that identifying as a feminist does not mean you support an individual's misguidied interpretation of the idea, If you dislike feminism you do not believe in gender equality",1,"The comment frames the issue as a binary where being against feminism equates to supporting male privilege and opposing gender equality, implying that gains for one group (women) are losses for another (men), which is characteristic of zero-sum thinking.","{

121,"""You realize that feminism has never wanted women's superiority (anti-feminists have been claiming this for over 100 years)"" Eh, fuck them anyways because yes they do, they always say all men are rapists. Fuck my friend stopped talking to me because I said feminism is cancer since he said blowing smoke near a woman is RAPE. If a woman thinks thats rape she's stupid and doesn't need to be listened to. Same goes with a man who views it that way. ""there are currently more Mexicans leaving the US than arriving (according to Pew Hispanic)"" I guess it's subjective but I find it weird because Mexico is HORRIBLE. Like damn, i've been and they try to rip you off and all that because they're poor they think they're entitled. ""the average Muslim is the same as the average Christian or Jew-- ordinary, peaceful people trying to live their ordinary, peaceful lives and practise their faith privately.""I know, I have no problem with muslims but in the middle east it's a bit different when their religion dictates the law of a country. Islam isn't a ""peaceful"" religion right now. And don't bring up christianity because yes templars were shitty but there's no international terrorists christians blowing people up and throwing gays off buildings. ""Have you ever looked into police brutality statistics against black people; or rape statistics; or inequalities in hiring practises based on race and gender?"" Of course, i'm educated, I KNOW all this shit. I'm not dumb but yeah im self centered because these fuckers would throw me under the bus because their problems are worse than mine because I have more money than them. Also, I used to be enraged but now I don't care because nobody does shit anyways. Protesting with cardboard signs is laughable but so are riots. If I was a corrupt police officer, a cardboard sign won't stop me, and shooting my brethren would make me more inclined to continue. They don't seem to understand the other side which makes me have less sympathy for them. ""Why is it fun to see her fail at her mission of bringing more equality?"" Because she's stupid and wrong about most things. Her ideas are dangerous and she doesn't want ""equality"" she thinks she does but if she had her way it would just be a matriarchy.  ""What do you think Bernie Sanders would tell you if he heard you talking about how you think mass deportations are a good idea because you want to see people you think are too strident not get their way?"" Never said it was a good idea. I'm pro immigration, they do jobs we hate. They pick most our food, they're willing to also do jobs cheaper. I'm just saying IF trump did that then I wouldn't be upset because yes it'd hurt us but hell, we managed to have Hilary V. Trump...kinda shows what kind of people we are as a nation. ""It belies your self-interest again.""
Of course. I have to be selfish because I don't have anyone but myself, yet people still want to take it away and usually those people are SJW's. EVeryones selfish, I promise you that you're selfish too and a lot of what you vote is out of self interest. Fuck, I voted bernie even though he wasn't my self interest but that's because I wanted us to be more like Europe. Now I don't think we'll get to that point. ""Trump has, by all evidence, defrauded people out of millions of dollars. He wants Russian hackers to attack Hillary Clinton."" Ok, well that's not suprising they both want power. I'm honestly not too mad, it's stupid but i'm not that mad. Sorry. I wouldn't be mad if Hilary did the same to Trump. ""The man is an untrustworthy liar, and yet you want to vote for him because you hate teenagers who stand up for minorities too enthusiastically."" They'd be just as dangerous in power and they stand up for minorities who are black, women and mexican. Nobody else. You can be mentally ill, you can be disabled, you can be a severly depressed white man with no legs, you can be a homeless,  you can be a black conservative most of them won't help you. They'll only help and FEEL offended for you if you're skin color is a certain color AND your beliefs are just like theres. In all honesty, I love people and care about people. But it's hard a lot of times because I've learned I have to be selfish most of the time because nobody else really gives a shit about people. And also I'll most likely end up not voting but it's just like even Trump Supporters I meet are less violent and kinder to me than the others. I went to a trump rally, I was on the side of bernie and nobody said shit to me, they just went saying, ""kill all white people"" and smashing cars and fighting with trump supporters and making kids of trump supporters cry. Then I went to the Trump side and got friendly hellos.  I wasn't dressed nice, i was dressed like a protestor would be but still treated WAY better. It's not because im white or male either.

If everyone in the world was in a same sex relationship, the human population would be gone in 4 generations. That is a *very* bad thing. I have no issue with LGBT couples.
