107,"""Aka: I have no argument, I just wanna hate on those Evil Feminist"" I've presented detailed arguments and there is nothing wrong with hating evil people. Don't want me to hate you? Convince me that you and your group aren't as evil as my experience of you suggests. Don't act as if I'm being absurd for judging you when the evidence I have says your ideology is fucking awful. ""Personally I don't view a single opinion article and one organization (which does have programs for men fyi) as enough support to say ""all of western society accepts this"".""I didn't say all of western society accepts it. I said it was a position held by feminist groups. What is the critical number of articles you need to be convinced that it is actually a thing that feminists advocate for? ""Regardless, every feminist I know, myself included, is against the prison complex that does hurt men..."" Yes, sure you are. Every men's issue is totally a concern for feminists when their failure to address them is rubbed in their faces by anti-feminists. The moment you aren't arguing with us, suddenly it doesn't seem to be quite so pressing. But feel free to link me to all the feminists campaigning for equal prison time. I'm sure it's a far more significant issue for you than manspreading or sexy video game characters so there will be plenty of campaigns about it. I like the way you are 'against the prison complex' rather than the discrimination. So we should be sending fewer people to prison in general? Of course, when an issue mostly affects women, feminists make sure that all the support is given to women. When it mostly affect men, then it's time to treat *everyone* better. ""...why is it a zero sum game?"" Because people like you declared war on people like me and turned everything into a battle. ""Why can't everyone go to jail less?""
Because some of them are fucking dangerous criminals, maybe? ""I wonder why? MRAs paint this huge anti-feminist picture and then expect feminist to just join in. Literally every post in /r/mensrights right now is complaining about women/feminist, I.e., you and this thread.

You try and shut down any discussion you can't control. You spread lies about groups fighting for equality. You pull fire alarms, call in bomb threats, protest anyone who dares to question you. Your forums are full of nonsense and hatred. How exactly do you expect to be treated?

Island nation B now doesn't have to work as hard to produce the food they need. The prices of food go down and they have more free time. This is wonderful right? Island nation A gets money that they want and island nation B gets cheaper food which translates into more free time. The problem is, island nation B is giving all their wealth to island nation A in exchange for cheap disposable goods that doesn't add any wealth to their nation.
