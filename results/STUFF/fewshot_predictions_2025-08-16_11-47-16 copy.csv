Having documents expire is different from being totally undocumented. 9. black immigrants have more education and tend to have more legal standing to come to the country 10. The point is that America is not as friendly to black immigrants as it is to latino immigrants, which comes from racist countries themselves. 11. Remittances are highest in the illegal hispanic community costing the country tons of money. 12. Another mistruth on your end. Its an example of legitimate black labor being displaced and favored by those employing illegals. 13. Because racism IS bad. And blacks shouldn't have to face it, in addition to many other obstacles. How disingenuous can you be? 14. The point is that the USA doesn't have an equitable immigration policy to illegal immigrants, which coincidentally doesn't favor black people. 15. because everyone else gets to play identity politics on the election stage instead of blacks who get everything compared to fucking slavery as if it makes a point. 16.
