135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.

123,You honestly are attempting to argue that Islam is compatible with western culture? Sharia councils are used in Muslim countries and in the UK as a sort of tribunal to settle disputes within Islam. We have a very different legal system founded from secular roots. Under no circumstances should an Islamic council of any sort be allowed to issue an judgement in a western country and there is not s single reason any Muslim apologist can give to the contrary. Turkey has traditionally been a fault line between the west and the Islamic world. Attaturk was a secularist and you are referencing a Turkey that is been purged away in front of us as we speak. Erdogan is an Islamist. His political party endorse political Islam. That is in no way compatible with our legal system. Would you want an Islamist political party standing for election in a Western European nation or the US? If you say yes then in my eyes you are trying to destroy the very country you live in.
