Being fat is not an activity. Mechanically, quitting ""being fat"" is extremely difficult and quitting the actual activity of overeating will not result in an immediate fix. There's also arguably a better moral position against smoking than against overeating, as the external negatives of smoking (potential health effects of second hand smoke, the smell) are unavoidable if you are near a person who is smoking.  Even if you want to shame the behavior of overeating, the external negatives aren't as universal (if they even exist at all).

82,"I think if you are at the point where you are giving gifts primarily to avoid the awkwardness of giving nothing, it's time to have a conversation about not wanting to do the gift thing any more. I'm not saying negotiation is bad, but it's not the realm of conventional gift giving. Collaboratively getting together and making an experience out of buying a gift is great! But this fact doesn't preclude that giving gifts is also good. There's lots of situations where you can't visit the store together, and while I agree with you that it's potentially very fun to receive money or gift cards and to make a good day out of spending them, in practice, this isn't what happens. Even if is, it's a lot of work, and if all gifts required effort on the receiver's end, there would be a big loss of utility. I'll return to my point:When you start asking for money, you alienate the giver, and reduce gift giving to practical exchange. This is bad because gift giving as an activity is fun and has value! There's also problems with it, and it's not for every relationship, but this is a fundamental argument for gift giving.",1,"Asking for money as a gift devalues the gift giver and renders it a practical exchange , Asking for money instead of gifts will upset the gift-giver and reduce the overall value of the gift",0,The comment discusses gift-giving nuances and social dynamics without framing the interaction as a strict win/lose scenario.

135,"Ok... I addressed each of your reasons point by point, and that's a straw man?  If you're trying to just say that the gains to society of piracy outweigh the cost to the creators, that's fine, but that doesn't seem to be what your points are asserting. So, let's look at that. Without question, those who consume pirated material benefit in the short term.  They get stuff they want at no cost to them. Also without question, those who create pirated material lose in the short term.  No, they aren't harmed by those who wouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, but a significant amount of their stuff is pirated by people who would have paid if there was not another option. Now, if Taylor Swift only makes $2 million instead of $6 million, no big deal.  But if a moderately-successful artist who would have made $60,000 of the people who would have been willing to pay only makes $20,000, that's no longer enough to be a full-time artist.  Or a game company only has $300k to split between the whole team that developed a game rather than $3million, people are going to quit. It's simply not sustainable.  More people will need to just do art as a hobby.  You simply can't be as good if you aren't working and practicing as much.  The quality of the works available will decrease  - which is a net negative to society.",1,"pirating work from artisits comes at direct detriment to society, By allowing people to pirate media, it will severely negatively impact artists and creators, which ultimately leads to a decrease in the quality/amount of art/media available",1,"The comment frames piracy as a direct zero-sum conflict between creators and consumers, where gains for one group (free content) are explicitly portrayed as direct losses for the other group (reduced artist income), with no possibility of mutual benefit or alternative outcomes.","{
