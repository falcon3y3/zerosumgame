50,"""Certainly this sort of language is not conducive to actual understanding.""I agree: the caricature you've portrayed of the authors position is probably not all that fair. Now, I haven't read this particular book that you speak of, but I can see a line of reasoning in between the lines of your paraphrase and it is fairly common--which leads me to believe you are not being charitable in your interpretation. Can't imagine much understanding can take place amidst this kind of misrepresentation. And clearly not much understanding did take place if you think what the author is saying is that of ""equating today's whites with the whites of 200 years"", as if the author is blaming white people today for the actions of white people 200 years ago. Because of the way you've read the author, it seems like you want to say that we don't owe reparations. This is what you are saying, right? Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Clarifying your position might be helpful for me, as it seems like there are a few distinct issues in your post that are being blurred together.) I think you might be arguing against something nobody is arguing. Lets look at an analogy, which will hopefully clear up some of the confusion (but not all of it (it is not the best analogy and only addresses one point, and also leave behind many subtleties)). Let's say person A cheats person B out of their life savings. Most would consider what A did to B was wrong, and that the money the A now has in their possession is ill-gotten or illegitimate. This leaves B in a very poor spot, dissolving the life prospects of B and their family. Now, suppose that A and B both die and pass on their belongings to there children: A has child G, and B has child R. G now owns all the money that A cheated B out of (and by extension cheated R out of). R is worse off now than they would have been had not A cheated B. G is better off than they would have been had not A cheated B. Now, can you honestly say that the money that G has now, by way of inheritance, somehow is not still illegitimate, just because it has been passed on to someone else's hands? By what magic would this ill-gotten money cleans itself? If G was at all concerned with justice, what do you suppose they would do with the money? I think what justice calls for is for G to pay reparations to R, even though G is not the person that cheated B out of their money. No one is blaming G for what A did, but G is blameable and complicit if they do nothing to right the wrong, especially when one has or is currently benefitting from said wrong at the expense of others. A wrong that is never redressed does not just go away if we ignore it. ""Every white person alive (shit, probably even modern Klansmen) can convey that history of white appropriations are to blame for virtually every economic, political, and probably social issues blacks in the Americas face."" I can point you to some subs here on reddit, if you want, where a majority of the users don't believe this.

&gt;there's nothing you or I can do about it. 

Bullshit. There is nothing we can do to change the actual past, but there is plenty we can do going forward.

&gt;The author is being condescending

Let's pretend that this is actually about language and/or method of the message. Why is being condescending off the table? Why is it such a bad tactic, especially when no one seriously cares to hear what you have to say otherwise (particularly when it falls outside of the dominate narrative)? You understand how debilitating marginalization is, right? It seems to me this call for politeness is still the dominate group setting the rules of the game in their favor. Why should the subordinated group not try to find other ways to get a voice, outside of the ""acceptable ways of discourse"" determined for them? Why should they not be mad and frustrated? What have they got to lose when they are mostly silenced anyways?",1,"Telling marginalized groups to ask for reparations more politely is doing them a disservice; re position of poster, sets up following framework: people don't want reparations because they feel it can only exist if they take responsbility or blame for past crimes/ slavery , argument for reparations being met with all white people are responsible for all problems, the idea being you can either fester in the past or move forward clean in the future, no middle ground",1,"The analogy of inheritance frames the issue of reparations as one group benefiting at the direct expense of another, and the discussion of marginalized groups being silenced versus dominant groups setting the rules further reinforces a gain/loss dynamic between groups.","{""zero_sum"": 1, ""justification"": ""The analogy of inheritance frames the issue of reparations as one group benefiting at the direct expense of another, and the discussion of marginalized groups being silenced versus dominant groups setting the rules further reinforces a gain/loss dynamic between groups.""}",2025-08-15_20-12-40
112,"""The massive social campaign ""normalizing"" illegals doesn't help either."" Campaigns normalizing blacks and giving them equal rights increased competition and supply in the labor force and lowered my value as a white laborer.  Should I be against giving blacks equal rights for this reason? ""Were you confused? Really? Black to african american and back? REALLY?! They're still AMERICAN CITIZENS. Don't b stupid.

That clearly indicates you aren't interested in a rational discussion and just want to insult me. 2) Blacks weren't legal American citizens until the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.  The founding document of the United States declares that they are 3/5th of human beings.  Blacks are living proof that a group of people's status can change over time and the issue of citizenship is a highly racial issue.  Why is it different for Latin Immigrants? 3) The fact that citizenship of blacks has changed over time proves that your idea that citizenship is a black and white (no pun intended) issue is completely false.""Were you confused? Really? Black to african american and back? REALLY?! They're still AMERICAN CITIZENS. Don't b stupid."" I can say the same thing right back at you:  'Were you really confused?

48,"There is not overwhelming evidence to refute my claim. There is no way to detect mental illnesses solely by testing the chemical and structural properties of the body. Look at the diagnostic criteria in the DSM for schizophrenia. It lists behaviour and then exclusion criteria for medical conditions:
http://www.schizophrenia.com/ami/diagnosis/mrBIPOL.html And it's also not the case that there is a test that can be done during autopsy looking at brain structure to determine whether the person was mentally ill. There is no evidence that mental illness is a result of faults in the body. As a result the fact that people who commit suicide were diagnosed as mentally ill provides no evidence that it is a medical problem. And it would be surprising if there was such evidence. There is more to life then whether your body happens to be working properly. There are problems to do with stuff other than medicine, like debt, loneliness, employment problems, boredom, problems getting along with relatives or friends and other stuff too. You think all of that stuff is a medical problem?",1,"no way to detect suicidality biologically means it isn't medical , there are insufficient physical indicators to diagnose mental illness with, which makes people assume mental illness is just medical (gain), when instead there are piles of factors that are not medical being overlooked (loss)",0,The comment debates the medical versus social origins of mental illness without framing it as a gain/loss conflict between groups; it does not present one side's gain as another's loss.,"{""zero_sum"": 0, ""justification"": ""The comment debates the medical versus social origins of mental illness without framing it as a gain/loss conflict between groups; it does not present one side's gain as another's loss.""}",2025-08-15_20-12-40

Award shows - if you are in America, turn on the tv! We just had the BET show for example. Parades - We have black pride parades. Chinese New Year too but that feels more inclusive of all peoples. Maybe I'm just feeling left out because I'm white, lol! Idk, for all the talk about how racism and discrimination are bad, things like this feel designed to promote those very ideas. ""Is it not feasible to fight the idea that we are supposed to be different based on color or religion, if that's what causing racism?"" But I don't think we are fighting that idea as a whole. We create clubs and award shows as a defense against racism, but I would argue that much of the time it does the opposite because it excludes everyone else. It promotes segregation and exclusion of other groups by its very existence. It's counter-intuitive.

83,"""ultimately the main purpose of giving a gift is to find something the other person wants"" I think the main purpose of giving a gift is to show that you put thought into who they are as a person, and gave them something that took you time and thought to put together or pick out, and something that maybe they wouldn't have bought for his/herself.
